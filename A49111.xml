            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Have learned long ſince not to <hi>appear empty before the
Lord,</hi> nor without an <hi>Offering</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo immediate a
<hi>Miniſter of God.</hi> This therefore (ſuch as it is) I humbly devote to
the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the <hi>Church of God</hi> as it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed among
us: which contains a <hi>Vindication</hi> as well of the <hi>Heal</hi> as
<hi>Chief Members</hi> of Church and State from the <hi>ſcandalous
imputation</hi> of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,</hi> and charge of <hi>the ſane</hi> upon
their <hi>Accuſers,</hi> in an impartial relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>matters of
fact.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is I confeſs one of the <hi>meanest,</hi> 
               <pb facs="tcp:101057:3"/>yet a
very <hi>neceſſary Work,</hi> to remove thoſe <hi>Stumbling-blocks</hi>
and <hi>heaps of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs</hi> which <hi>men of perverſe minds</hi>
have laid to obſtruct the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples entrance to our Church: among which, none
hath given greater of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence than the clamour of <hi>Popery</hi> and
<hi>Idolatry. Come to the Presbyterian Clergie</hi> (ſays the L. C. J.
<hi>Hales</hi> in a Pamphlet lately publiſhed by <hi>R. B.</hi> p. 28.)
<hi>and they will tell you that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopal Government is Romiſh and
Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious, and their Ceremonies and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſages Antichriſtian.</hi> Yea
they will come to the People, and tell them, (without asking) that the
<hi>Royal Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr was the Head of the Grotian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> (i. e.) of
<hi>Popery:</hi> That your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned and Religious <hi>Predeceſſor</hi>
Archbiſhop <hi>Laud laboured to introduce Popery</hi> (though he were in
truth the greateſt <hi>Scourge</hi> and <hi>Horrour</hi> to <hi>that
Party.</hi>) The Great Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> and the Learned Dr.
<hi>Couſin,</hi> were <pb facs="tcp:101057:3"/>proclaimed and perſecuted as
<hi>Papiſts,</hi> though living and dying they gave Demonſtrations to the
contrary.</p>
            <p>And evident it is, that theſe falſe Suggeſtions were really
and purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>intended</hi> and <hi>fomented,</hi> to animate the
people, and actually engage them in one of the moſt <hi>horrid
Rebellions</hi> that ever was acted by any barbarous people. Yet is this
<hi>Outcry</hi> renewed, and to the ſame <hi>miſchievous intent,</hi> as is
acknowledged by <hi>Holloway; That the general deſigne in which he enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
was to get off the King from his evil Counſel who had adviſed him to put a
ſtop to the proceedings againſt the Popiſh Plotters: That it was reported
in all parts that Arbitrary Government and Popery were coming in apace; which
incenſed the common people in all parts, and made ſuch a grumbling, that we
feared longer delays would make them mutiny.</hi> (This in his Paper to the
King.) And in that to the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs, <pb facs="tcp:101057:4"/>
               <hi>He was fully perſwaded
that not onely Popery, but Arbitrary Government was intended, and that he
believed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſands in the Nation would have appeared on theſe
reaſons.</hi> And in this he perſiſted at his Execution, telling the
Sheriffs, <hi>That it was feared that Arbitrary Government and Popery was
deſigned; and truly I think at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, by what I can underſtand,
that there is little better deſigned.</hi> Thus the preſent Government is
newly dreſſed up in the old Rags of <hi>Popery,</hi> as the Primitive
Chriſtians were in <hi>Beaſt skins,</hi> to expoſe them to the rage of
the people.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>W. J.</hi> in his <hi>Celeuſma</hi> accuſeth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the
Conforming Clergy to be <hi>ſpecie duntaxat Proteſtantes,</hi> and that
they do <hi>ſuppariſitare Pelagio-Socino, ſed imprimis Papae &amp;
Papiſmo;</hi> though it be no leſs than a contradiction, that they ſhould
be at the ſame time, <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians</hi> and <hi>Papiſts.</hi> And ſtill
the <pb facs="tcp:101057:4"/>
               <hi>Cry</hi> is carried on, That our Hierarchy is
<hi>Antichriſtian,</hi> and that we have ſcarce two or three
<hi>Proteſtant Biſhops</hi> in our Communion: That the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy is
<hi>Popiſhly affected,</hi> and are <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors for Rome:</hi> That our
Church hath made <hi>many ſteps to Popery:</hi> That our Liturgy is the
<hi>Maſs in Engliſh,</hi> and the Litany a <hi>Popiſh
Conjuration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From theſe <hi>malevolent Suggeſtions</hi> it is, that the
credulous people are not onely affrighted from our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, as if our
Temples (like thoſe of the <hi>Egyptians</hi>) were filled with
<hi>Serpents</hi> and <hi>Crocodiles;</hi> but are dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven into <hi>Sedition,
Conſpiracies,</hi> and <hi>Rebellion,</hi> and into many <hi>inextricate
Errours,</hi> and hurried from one <hi>Sect</hi> and <hi>Hereſie</hi> to
another, till they fall into that common Sink of <hi>Quakeriſm,</hi> which is
a compound of the dregs of <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Fanaticiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There ſeems to be (and God be thanked for it) a general
<hi>abhorrence</hi> 
               <pb facs="tcp:101057:5"/>of <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Popery</hi> in the
hearts of the people; but that the <hi>eſtabliſhed Church</hi> is guilty of
theſe <hi>Abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> is the <hi>miſchievous inſinuation</hi> of
unreaſonable and malicious men, who ſeek to <hi>raiſe themſelves</hi>
upon <hi>its ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine.</hi> And with ſuch <hi>invincible preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices</hi> are
the minds of too many poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt, that they are deaf to all
<hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> and <hi>Demonſtrations</hi> to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; they are as
ſecure, as if they had been taught by an Oracle: ſince Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi>
(as <hi>Grotius,</hi> p. 115. of his <hi>Votum pro Pace</hi>) obſerved,
<hi>Illam mutationem quae Buceri conſilio in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glia erat inſtituta
Papiſmi accuſavit:</hi> and <hi>T. C.</hi> taught, That <hi>they ought
ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to conform themſelves in Orders and Ceremonies to the faſhion of
the Turks than the Papiſts.</hi> (See <hi>p.</hi> 27. of the <hi>Confer. at
Hampton-Court.</hi>) And the <hi>Popery</hi> which is now ſo vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
oppoſed, is that which our <hi>Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> conceive to be
practiſed in the <hi>eſtabliſhed Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:101057:5"/>
            <p>But the inconſiderate <hi>Multitude</hi> will not perceive, that
while they are affrighted by ſuch <hi>Shades</hi> and <hi>Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritions</hi>
from the Communion of our Church, they do really embrace the moſt dangerous
and diſtinguiſhing <hi>Articles</hi> and <hi>Principles</hi> of the
<hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts.</hi> They do as verily believe that the <hi>Presbytery</hi>
or the <hi>People</hi> have a <hi>Supreme Power</hi> over the <hi>Chief
Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,</hi> as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> affirm the <hi>Pope</hi> to have.
And as he challengeth the <hi>Keys</hi> and <hi>Sword</hi> of St.
<hi>Peter,</hi> ſo do they the <hi>Crown</hi> and <hi>Scepter</hi> of
<hi>Christ,</hi> (for ſo they ſtick not to call <hi>their
Diſcipline</hi>) to which all <hi>Powers</hi> on Earth muſt <hi>bow</hi> or
<hi>be broken.</hi> And their <hi>Practice</hi> hath been agreeable to theſe
<hi>Principles:</hi> for from hence that <hi>damnable Doctrine</hi> (as St.
<hi>Paul</hi> calls it) of <hi>reſiſting</hi> the lawful Powers, and the
practices of <hi>open Rebellion</hi> and <hi>ſecret Conſpiracies,</hi> have
been of late days as <hi>frequent</hi> among <hi>Fanaticks</hi> as among the 
<pb facs="tcp:101057:6"/>
               <hi>Papiſts.</hi> And they preſume to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonize</hi>
thoſe that periſh in <hi>Rebellion</hi> as <hi>Saints</hi> and
<hi>Martyrs,</hi> as the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hath done by <hi>Thomas Becket</hi>
and <hi>Father Garnet.</hi> Nor hath any <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> or
<hi>Provincial</hi> of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted a more <hi>blind
obedience,</hi> or uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped a more <hi>uncontroulable power</hi> over the
Conſciences of their Proſelytes and Emiſſaries, than ſome of theſe
have done. So that indeed, many of their <hi>Principles</hi> and
<hi>Practices</hi> are but <hi>old Popery</hi> in the <hi>new dreſs of

their <hi>Independent Brethren,</hi> out of their <hi>own Books of
Diſcipline.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor yet will their <hi>Leaders</hi> ſeem ſenſible of the
<hi>peſtilent effects</hi> of ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalizing the eſtabliſhed Government
with the <hi>growth of Popery;</hi> when their <hi>own Diſciples,</hi> having
pluckt their Spectacles from their noſes, can as plainly diſcern
<hi>Popery</hi> not onely in <pb facs="tcp:101057:6"/>their <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> and
<hi>Diſcipline,</hi> and in every thing that they retained for
<hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> and <hi>Decency,</hi> but in their <hi>Sabbaths</hi> and
<hi>Sacraments,</hi> in their very Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of <hi>Repentance</hi> and
<hi>good works,</hi> and in that of the <hi>bleſſed Trinity</hi> it ſelf:
all which have been ridicul'd as <hi>Popiſh</hi> by ſome that paſs for
<hi>true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants.</hi> But in all their <hi>Calumnies</hi> our
Adverſaries meet with the ſame fate and infatuation as other falſe
Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers of innocent perſons commonly do; their very <hi>Charge</hi>
carrieth a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation</hi> with it; being laid againſt thoſe who have
given the plaineſt demonſtrations of their <hi>deteſtation</hi> of
<hi>Popery,</hi> and have <hi>acted</hi> moſt <hi>rational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſucceſsfully</hi> againſt it; while the <hi>Informers</hi> are
notoriouſly known to agree in the <hi>ſame Principles,</hi> and to
conſpire in the <hi>ſame Practices</hi> as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> do, for
the deſtruction of <hi>that Church</hi> which hath been acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by all
ſober <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and <pb facs="tcp:101057:7"/>dreaded by the
<hi>Papiſts</hi> as their moſt formidable Enemy.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and <hi>Diſſenters</hi> have ſo long
contrived and communicated <hi>politick Maximes</hi> and <hi>Counſels</hi>
for the ſubverſion of our Eſtabliſhment, and <hi>confederated</hi> in
practices tending to that end, that it is hard to determine whether there be
now more <hi>Fanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm</hi> among the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> or more
<hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitiſm</hi> among the <hi>Fanaticks:</hi> As in the ſtory of two
<hi>famous Brothers,</hi> the one a <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> the other a
<hi>Calvinist;</hi> who diſputed ſo plauſibly and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully for
their <hi>Opinions,</hi> that the <hi>Calviniſt</hi> was perſwaded to
embrace <hi>Popery,</hi> and the <hi>Papiſt</hi> to eſpouſe
<hi>Calviniſm:</hi> and yet they were <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi> ſtill. And if
ſuch perſons as act to the <hi>ſame end,</hi> and uſe the <hi>ſame
means,</hi> are equally criminal, I know not how to make a
<hi>diſtinction</hi> where I ſee no real <hi>difference.</hi> Certain it
is, that as <hi>Fanaticiſm</hi> could never <pb facs="tcp:101057:7"/>have grown to ſo
<hi>great a bulk</hi> among us, if it had not been nouriſhed by
<hi>Popery;</hi> ſo <hi>Popery</hi> would have been extreamly <hi>weak</hi>
and <hi>languiſhing,</hi> if it had not been encouraged and anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by
<hi>Fanaticiſm.</hi> No other Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice could have made the <hi>Popiſh
Plot</hi> to be ſuſpected of a <hi>Sham</hi> (as ſome have called it) but
that <hi>Conſpiracy</hi> of ſome which call themſelves <hi>true
Proteſtants,</hi> but have ſerved the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Cauſe</hi> and
<hi>Interest</hi> more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageouſly than all their own <hi>Conſults</hi>

            <p>I ſhould not have preſumed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate this Treatiſe to

buſie to ſtifle it <pb facs="tcp:101057:8"/>before it came to its birth, as the <hi>old
Mumpſimus</hi> was. And in <hi>ſucceeding times,</hi> the Government had as
watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and jealous an eye, and carried as ſtrict a hand over the <hi>one
Faction</hi> as over the <hi>other;</hi> reſtraining them by the <hi>ſame
Laws,</hi> and executing the <hi>ſame Penalties</hi> on both; as appears by
thoſe wholſome Statutes made in Q. <hi>Eliz. to retain her Majeſties
Subjects in due Obedience;</hi> which have been ever interpreted by the
<hi>wiſe Judges</hi> and <hi>common Practice</hi> of the Nation,
<hi>equally</hi> to concern <hi>Diſſenters</hi> of all ſorts. It
therefore ſeems an <hi>unaccountable Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour</hi> in them who profeſs a
<hi>deteſtation</hi> of <hi>Popery,</hi> to attempt the <hi>abrogation</hi>
of thoſe Laws (eſpecially if (as the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> affirm)
<hi>they were intended chiefly against the Papiſts</hi>) as being a
<hi>Grievance</hi> to his Majeſties <hi>Proteſtant Subjects,</hi> and an
<hi>incouragement</hi> to <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery:</hi> when in all probability, the
<hi>Popiſh Conventicles</hi> would have been <pb facs="tcp:101057:8"/>as frequent as

<hi>Jeſuits</hi> could not have contrived a more probable means to gratifie
their <hi>Party,</hi> and advance their <hi>Interest,</hi> than by ſuch a
deſigne. Nor hath this been the <hi>first joynt attempt</hi> of the two
Factions to procure a To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration for <hi>each other;</hi> it being the
readieſt way to deſtroy the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Church, as the Letters of Mr.
<hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> and his <hi>endeavours</hi> did intimate.</p>
            <p>I fear I have tranſgreſſed the bounds of <hi>Modeſty,</hi>
as well as of an <hi>Epiſtle Dedicatory</hi> to a Perſon on whom the

conſideration: but that ſome of <hi>her own Fold,</hi> who wear the
<hi>Sheeps clothing,</hi> ſhould be made the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſuch
<hi>Cruelty,</hi> is that which adds to the <hi>Affliction!</hi> We were told
indeed long ſince, That <hi>England is a great Beaſt, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not die but
of her ſelf: our own Diviſions</hi> are the chief Stratagem by which
<hi>our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> promiſe themſelves ſucceſs; and we are
become <hi>ſo brutiſh,</hi> as to be acted by them (to <hi>bite and devour

<hi>theſe,</hi> we grow big with the <hi>like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns,</hi> and give birth
to that <hi>Icabod,</hi> which may ſhortly tell us, That <hi>the Ark of God
is taken,</hi> and <hi>the glory departed from</hi> our <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Confederacy</hi> againſt the Church, is not from any
<hi>love</hi> that the Enemies thereof bear to <hi>each other,</hi> but from an

               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:101057:10"/>of <hi>her,</hi> whom they ought
to love. Thus <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> though
<hi>Enemies</hi> to each other, acted <hi>both</hi> to the crucifying of our
Saviour; though <hi>Pilate</hi> (when it was too late) would have <hi>waſhed
his hands from</hi> that <hi>innocent Bloud.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though we did wantonly contend with one another about
<hi>trifles,</hi> while our <hi>common Mother</hi> had ſome
<hi>authority</hi> and <hi>power</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the miſchief of ſuch

them, who would deſtroy <hi>both,</hi> is ſuch an <hi>infatuation,</hi> as
preſageth no leſs than our <hi>common ruine.</hi> The <hi>Curſe of

than <hi>now.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>God makes <hi>mans extremity, his opportunity</hi> to ſhew

For however they ſeem <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite</hi> to each other, they are
<hi>agreed</hi> to do the <hi>Government</hi> a miſchief; and <hi>Duo quum

And of this, take the following inſtance.</p>
            <p>On <hi>October</hi> 3. 1643. there was a Letter ſent from
<hi>Dublin</hi> to a <hi>Member</hi> of the <hi>Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> which
ſhews by what example they acted, as followeth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There was a Fryar taken the laſt Expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into</hi>
Conaught, <hi>about whom was found a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of all your Votes, Ordinances,
and Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, carefully marked with ſhort marginal Notes out of which he
compoſed a large Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript intituled,</hi> An Apology of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> or a Juſtification of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive Arms for the
preſervation of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, <pb n="9" facs="tcp:101057:13"/>the maintenance of his
Majeſties Rights and Prerogatives, the natural and juſt defence of their
Lives and Eſtates, and the Liberty of their Country, by the practice of the
State of <hi>England,</hi> and the Judgment and Authority of both Houſes of
Parliament. <hi>It was penned with ſo little variation of Language, that the
name of</hi> Ireland <hi>being changed for</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>and the chief
Actors there, for thoſe under the Parliament, your own Clerk would ſcarce
know it from one of your own Declarations. All that they do, is for the good of
the King and Kingdom; he is intruſted with all for the good of the People; if
he diſchargeth not his truſt, but is adviſed by evil Counſellors, and
perſons they cannot confide in, 'tis their duty to ſee this Truſt
diſcharged according to the condition and true intent thereof: That they
ſaw their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Liberty in danger of extirpation, and therefore had
reaſon to put themſelves in a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of Defence; but are ready to lay
down their Arms, as ſoon as the great Offices of the Kingdom are put into
ſuch hands as they can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide in,</hi> &amp;c. Mutato nomine, de te Anglia
narratur.</p>
            <p>There is lately printed an excellent Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, vindicating the
<hi>Church of England</hi> from the imputation of <hi>Popery</hi> in
<hi>Doctrine, Worſhip,</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline;</hi> to which I refer my
Reader as to thoſe points. That which I deſigne, <pb n="10" facs="tcp:101057:14"/>is to
<hi>vindicate</hi> our <hi>Governours</hi> in <hi>Church</hi> and
<hi>State,</hi> principally thoſe who have been moſt accuſed, from the
<hi>like Aſperſions;</hi> and to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort</hi> the <hi>calumny</hi> of
their <hi>Accuſers,</hi> by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their <hi>Harmony</hi> and
<hi>Intrigues</hi> with the <hi>Papiſts</hi> both in <hi>Principles</hi> and
<hi>Practices;</hi> that the mouth of ſuch <hi>Slanderers</hi> may be
ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped.</p>
            <p>The following <hi>Collections</hi> may ſerve to convince all
well-affected perſons, that both the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and
<hi>Fanaticks</hi> (how contrary ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever to each other) are well agreed to
at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the <hi>Ruine</hi> of <hi>our Church as it is now
e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed;</hi> the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> under the pretence that we are
<hi>Hereticks;</hi> and the <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> that we are <hi>Papiſts:</hi>
but the true reaſon is, that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> may regain thoſe
<hi>Profits</hi> and <hi>Dignities</hi> which for a long time they uſurped in
<hi>this Nation,</hi> which was the <hi>moſt fruitful Garden</hi> that ever
the <hi>Pope</hi> claimed as belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Palace; and the
<hi>Fanaticks,</hi> that they may retrieve their former <hi>ſacrilegious
Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſes</hi> of <hi>Crown</hi> and <hi>Church-lands,</hi> and divide them
among themſelves. Of the firſt we have this evidence, That the
<hi>Pope</hi> fills up the places of our <hi>Biſhops, Deans,</hi> and other
<hi>Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitaries,</hi> to encourage his Emiſſaries: of which we have this
<hi>Specimen</hi> in print.</p>

            <p>Many other <hi>Dignities</hi> are by the <hi>Popes Bull</hi>
diſpoſed of to Foreigners: but theſe, being of our Kings Dominions, have
been many of them diligent Promoters of our <hi>Wars,</hi> that they might
<hi>kill and take poſſeſſion.</hi> Judge now what temptation our
<hi>preſent Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi> have to bring in <hi>Popery,</hi> when the
co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in of <hi>that,</hi> will turn them out of their <hi>Dignities</hi> and

            <pb n="13" facs="tcp:101057:15"/>
            <p>And that the <hi>Fanaticks</hi> aim at the <hi>ſame end,</hi> is
demonſtrable not onely from the <hi>unlimited power</hi> which ſome of

any of the <hi>Biſhops;</hi> but their dividing the <hi>moſt profitable
Benefices</hi> among themſelves, ſequeſtring thoſe <hi>loyal

alſo from a late <hi>Propoſal</hi> of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xter, Humfrys,</hi> and
<hi>Lob,</hi> in the name of <hi>other Nonconformiſts;</hi> who would ſtill
retain the name of <hi>Biſhops,</hi> ſo they might have the <hi>power</hi>
and <hi>profit:</hi> for they would have ſome choſen out of the

could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe it (as they ſay.) And indeed, at the time of making this
<hi>Propoſal,</hi> theſe <hi>wiſe men,</hi> like the <hi>wiſe
Ladies</hi> of <hi>Siſera</hi>'s Mother, had <hi>divided the Spoil, to every
man a prey</hi> of two or three <hi>Dignities,</hi> beſides the <hi>Garments

faſcination</hi> in <hi>ſome,</hi> to ſerve the luſts of thoſe that

            <p>It is well known how impetuouſly <hi>both</hi> theſe

and deſpairing to do it by <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Argument,</hi> they
endeavour to do it by <hi>wicked Arts</hi> and <hi>Arms,</hi> or <hi>bloudy
Aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinations.</hi> One <hi>Engine</hi> that hath had a

againſt our <hi>Governours</hi> in Church and State, as being
<hi>Antichriſtian</hi> and <hi>Popiſhly affected.</hi> Thus our
<hi>martyred King</hi> and <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop,</hi> and generally <hi>all the
Biſhops</hi> in thoſe days, with other <hi>chief Miniſters of State,</hi>
were condemned as <hi>Papiſts;</hi> though the <hi>Lye</hi> were ſo

time of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation,</hi> ſought to debauch the Nation;
eſpecially by <hi>one</hi> prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the year 1652, called <hi>The Grounds
of Obedience and Government,</hi> with this <hi>abuſed Maxime</hi> in the
Title-page, <hi>Salus Populi Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prema <pb n="16" facs="tcp:101057:17"/>lex eſto;</hi>
which was applied in a <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken ſence,</hi> to <hi>very ill
purpoſes,</hi> by the <hi>Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</hi> In this Book, like a <hi>Prieſt
of Mars,</hi> he ſcatters theſe <hi>Fire-brands,</hi> enough to ſet any
Kingdom on <hi>fire;</hi> and compoſed it in a <hi>ſmall Tract,</hi> like
ſo many <hi>hand-Granado's</hi> fitted for every mans fingers. Theſe are
his Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: 
<list>
                  <item>Firſt, <hi>That the Magiſtrate by his miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages
abdicates himſelf from being a Magiſtrate, and proveth a Robber inſtead
of a</hi> Defender; <hi>which laſt word he writes with a great D, to ſhew
whom he meant.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Secondly, <hi>That by the evil management or
inſufficiency of Governours, it is remitted to the force of nature to provide
for our ſelves; and that we are not bound by any promiſe made to our
Governours,</hi> p. 123, 124.</item>
                  <item>Thirdly, <hi>if the Magiſtrate have truly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to
be diſpoſſeſſed, or if it be rationally doubted that he hath
deſerved it, and be actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally out of poſſeſſion, a Subject hath no
obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to hazard for his reſtitution, but rather to hinder it: for
ſince it is the common good that both the Magiſtrate and the Subject are to
aim at, it is the common harm to admit again of ſuch a Magiſtrate; and
every one is bound to his power to reſiſt him,</hi> p. 133. <hi>if he be
innocent, and wrong-fully depoſed, nay let us adde, one that hath governed
well, and deſerved much of <pb n="17" facs="tcp:101057:17"/>the Commonwealth, yet is he
totally diſpoſſeſſed; and in theſe circumſtances, it were better
for the common good to ſtay as they are, than to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the reſtoring of
him, becauſe of the publick hazard. — And the diſpoſſeſſed
Prince is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged abſolutely to renounce all right and claim to Government;
and if he doth not, he is worſe than an Infidel,</hi> p. 135, 136. <hi>If the
People by any circumſtance be devolved to the ſtate of Anarchy, their
Promiſe made to their expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Governour binds no more,</hi> p. 122.</item>
                  <item>Fourthly, <hi>That when the Peoples Good ſtands on the
Poſſeſſors ſide, then clearly he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, and then the People think
themſelves well, and they manifeſtly conſent to the preſent
Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: for who can aſſure they ſhall be better by return of the
diſpoſſeſſed Party? Surely by the common preſumption, the Gainer is
like to defend them better than the Loſer.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>P. 130. From whence he deduceth three <hi>Corollaries:</hi> 1.
<hi>When Providence depriveth a man of his underſtanding and intellectual
capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, and that ſtatedly to his ordinary temper, it maketh him uncapable
of Government, though not of the name,</hi> Theſ. 135. 2. <hi>If God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
Princes to turn ſo wicked, as to be uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of governing ſo as is
conſiſtent with the ends of Government, it makes him an uncapable Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of the power, and ſo depoſeth him.</hi> 3. <hi>If Providence ſtatedly
diſable him that was a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign from the executing of the Law, it makes him
an uncapable Subject of the power, and ſo depoſeth him,</hi> Theſ.
137.</p>
            <p>To which he adds: <hi>Though it is poſſible and likely that
the guilt is or may be theirs who have diſabled the Ruler by deſerting him,
yet he is diſmiſſed from the charge of Government, and particular
innocent Members are diſobliged from being governed by him, if the Governour
be juſtly diſpoſſeſſed, as by a lawful War</hi> (which Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> declares the War againſt King <hi>Charles the Firſt</hi>
was) <hi>in which he loſeth his right; eſpecially if he violate the
Conſtitution, and enter into a Military ſtate againſt the People, and by
them be conquered, they are not <pb n="19" facs="tcp:101057:18"/>obliged to reſtore him,
unleſs there be ſome ſpecial obligation upon them beſides their
Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance,</hi> Theſ. 145. <hi>If the perſon diſpoſſeſſed,
though it were unjuſtly, do afterwards become incapable of Government, it is
not the duty of his Subjects to ſeek his Reſtitution.</hi> Theſ. 146.
<hi>If an Army of Neighbours, Inhabitants (or who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever) do, though
injuriouſly, expel the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, and reſolve to ruine the Commonwealth,
rather than he ſhall be reſtored; and if the Commonwealth may proſper
without his reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is the duty of ſuch an injured Prince, for the
common good, to reſigne his Government; and if he will not, the People ought
to judge him as made uncapable by Providence, and not to ſeek his
reſtitution, to the apparent ruine of the Commonwealth,</hi> Theſ. 147.
<hi>If therefore the rightful Governour be ſo long diſpoſſeſſed,
that the Commonwealth can be no longer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, but to the apparent hazard of
its ruine, we</hi> (i. e.) <hi>the people that diſpoſſeſſed him, are
to judge that Providence hath diſpoſſeſſed the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and
preſently conſent to another,</hi> Theſ. 149. <hi>If a People that by
Oath and Duty are obliged to a Soveraign, ſhall ſinfully diſpoſſeſs
him, and contrary to their Covenants chuſe and covenant with another, they
may be obliged by their later Covenant, notwithſtanding their former,</hi>
Theſ. 181. <hi>If a Nation injuriouſly deprive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of a worthy
Prince, the hurt will be their <pb n="20" facs="tcp:101057:19"/>own, and they puniſh

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Milton</hi> printed a Book very well like this of Mr.

obſerve onely <hi>this Note</hi> among others in Mr. <hi>White,</hi> p. 158.
where he anſwers ſome Objections of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines concerning the Authority of
Princes and Non-reſiſtance. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>p ſteps the Divine</hi> (ſaith he)
<hi>to preach us out of Scripture the Duty we owe to Kings, no leſs than
Death and Damnation being the Guerdons of Diſobedience and Rebellion.</hi>
And p. 159. <hi>They will ſpeak reaſon too, telling us that God by nature
is high Lord and Maſter of all: That whoever is in power, receiveth his right
from him: That O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience conſiſts in doing the Will of him that
commandeth; and concludes that his Will ought to be obeyed till God taketh away
the obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> (i. e.) <hi>till he who is to be obeyed himſelf
releaſeth the right.</hi> And p. 160. <hi>They al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge that God by his
ſpecial command trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the Kingdom from</hi> Saul <hi>to</hi> David,
<hi>from</hi> Rehoboam <hi>to</hi> Jeroboam: <hi>ſo that, in fine, all that
is brought out of Scripture falleth ſhort of proving that no time can make
void the right of a King, once given him by the hand of God.</hi>

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> this weak way of alleadging
Scripture is, that when they read that God commandeth or doth this, they look
not into Nature to know what this commanding or doing is, but preſently
imagine God commands it by expreſs and direct words and doth it by an
immediate Poſition of the things ſaid to be done: whereas in Nature the
commands are nothing but the natural light God hath beſtowed on mankind, and
which is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore frequently called the Law of Nature Likewiſe Gods doing a
thing is many times one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the courſe of natural ſecond cauſes, to which
becauſe God gives the direction and motion, he both doth, and is ſaid to do
all that is done by them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe things are tranſcribed by Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> to the
<hi>ſame ends</hi> that Mr. <hi>White</hi> urged them. <hi>p.</hi> 144. of
his <hi>Poſtſcript. The nature of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and its Original</hi>
(ſaith he) <hi>hath been prejudiced by men, that underſtanding no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but
words, and Grammar-Divines, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out contemplating Gods Attributes, or the
nature of man, or the reaſonableneſs of moral Precepts, have undertaken to
declare the ſence of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and infer that Soveraign power is not of
humane inſtitution, but of divine appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe they find it there
written, that by him Kings raign; imagining that when the <pb n="23" facs="tcp:101057:20"/>Scripture ſaith God commands or doth this, that God commanded it by
expreſs words, or doth it by an immediate poſition of the thing done:
whereas in Nature his commands are nothing but the natural light God hath
beſtowed on man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; likewiſe Gods doing a thing is onely the courſe of
natural and ſecond cauſes, to which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God gives direction and

            </p>
            <p>After this, Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> rails againſt our

him to preſent him to the Biſhop for ſome Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In order to which,
he pretending himſelf to be a <hi>poor Miniſter,</hi> the Dean or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders him
to preach in the Cathedral; which he did on that Text, <hi>Acts</hi> 12.6.
<hi>Peter there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was kept in priſon, but prayers were made without
ceaſing in the Church to God for him;</hi> on which he told the people,
<hi>that it was not thoſe of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>but Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
prayers, that brought</hi> Peter <hi>out of priſon: and where</hi> (ſaid

<hi>Hallinghan, Benſon,</hi> and <hi>Coleman,</hi> have ſet a Faction among

whom the Letter calls <hi>German Hereticks,</hi> (i. e.) <hi>Lutherans:</hi>
which Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> notes out of Mr. <hi>Camb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, A. D.</hi>
1568. agreeing with the date of this Letter; who ſays, that while
<hi>Harding, Sanders,</hi> and others, attacked our Church on one ſide,
<hi>Coleman, Button, Hillingham, Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> and others, were buſie on
the other; who under a pretence of <hi>purer Reformation,</hi> oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the

approaching too near to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And theſe he notes to be

            </p>
            <p>So that while the <hi>Pope</hi> held the <hi>hot-Iron</hi> of

confeſſed that he was not whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the <hi>Epiſcopal party</hi> of

Proteſtants,</hi> and to take off all <hi>Smacks</hi> of <hi>Ceremonies,</hi>
that in the leaſt do tend to the <hi>Romiſh Faith.</hi> He confeſſed
alſo, that he knew the ſaid <hi>Sam. Malt,</hi> but objected, that the
Letter was not directed to him, but to one <hi>Thomas Finne;</hi> which (as the
Biſhop obſerved) was uſual a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Jeſuites.</hi> And to put the
matter out of controverſie, the Biſhop ſent to <hi>Heaths</hi> Lodgings,
where in one of his Boots were found his <hi>Beads,</hi> and a
<hi>Licenſe</hi> from the <hi>Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity</hi> of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and

            <p>
               <hi>Heath</hi> being <hi>Convicted</hi> of theſe things in
<hi>open Court,</hi> the Biſhop offered him, that if he would diſcover for
what cauſes he ran in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe <hi>Schiſms,</hi> and reform his courſe
of life, he and the whole Court would intercede for his pardon, and provide for
his future maintenance. To which he anſwered, <hi>My <pb n="35" facs="tcp:101057:26"/>Lord, I know not what I might have done had I not been ſo publickly
examined; but ſeeing my vocation is ſo publickly known, I ſhall not
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge my ſelf to be guilty of any Miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour: for I have fought a
good fight for Chriſt, whoſe cauſe I have taken in hand. This Experiment
I tryed among my Country-men, that the world may ſee, that all thoſe who
term themſelves Proteſtants are not of the Church of</hi> England,
<hi>though they ſpeak againſt</hi> Rome.</p>
            <p>The Biſhop hearing him ſpeak ſo obſtinately, ſaid,
<hi>Behold, my Brethren a Jeſuits Confeſſion, how he hath declared he had
ſet up a certain Form of Religion, purpoſely to withdraw you from the
Church of</hi> England: <hi>but woe be to thoſe deluders, and to thoſe that
will be deluded by them: we have a good Law, and the light of the Holy Goſpel
now flouriſhing among us, which hath for many years paſt been abſconded:
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, my Brethren, conſider the condition of your Souls; if you ſtart
aſide once from your Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, having the right way ſo plainly ſet
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, you will not only run into Popiſh ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very again, but be in
peril of a total confuſion of Soul and body. And if</hi> Rome <hi>get once
her foot on theſe dominions again, not only your ſelves and your Children,
but your Princes and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles ſhall become ſlaves to her Idolatry.</hi>

            <p>Then was he remanded to priſon, and for three days brought to
the Market-place <pb n="36" facs="tcp:101057:27"/>at <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> where he ſtood
by the <hi>High-croſs</hi> with a <hi>paper</hi> before his breaſt, in
which was written his <hi>Crimes:</hi> then he was <hi>Pillo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;</hi> and on
the laſt day his <hi>Ears cut off,</hi> his <hi>Noſe ſlit,</hi> and his
<hi>Forehead</hi> branded with the Letter <hi>R,</hi> and was condemned to
endure per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual <hi>impriſonment.</hi> But it laſted not long; for a few
Months after he dyed ſuddenly, not without the ſuſpition of having
poyſoned himſelf.</p>
            <p>How many other <hi>Romiſh Emiſſaries</hi> did act after this
manner, is not known; but certain it is, that they had prevailed with too many
to walk in their ſteps, and to carry on the work in the ſame method that
they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, to make a <hi>Separation</hi> among us: for the Authors of the
<hi>Admonition,</hi> in the 14 of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> declared they would
have <hi>neither Papiſts nor others conſtrained to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate:</hi> which
although (as A.B. <hi>Whitgift</hi> ſaith) they intended as a <hi>plea</hi>
for their own <hi>Separation</hi> from the <hi>Church,</hi> yet (ſaith he)
the <hi>Papiſts</hi> could not have met with better Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors: and
elſewhere he tells them, that they did the <hi>Pope</hi> very good ſervice;
and that he would not miſs them for any thing: for what is his deſire, but
to have the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which he hath <hi>accuſed,</hi>
utterly <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced</hi> and <hi>diſcredited,</hi> by any means
<hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown,</hi> if not by <hi>Forreign Enemies,</hi> yet by 
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:101057:27"/>
               <hi>domeſtical Diſſentions?</hi> and what fitter and
apter <hi>inſtruments</hi> could he have had for that purpoſe, than
<hi>you,</hi> who under pretence of <hi>zeal, overthrow</hi> that which other
men have <hi>buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;</hi> under colour of <hi>purity</hi> ſeeking to bring
in <hi>deformity;</hi> and under the cloak of <hi>equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> and
<hi>humility,</hi> would uſurp as great <hi>tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> and lofty
<hi>Lordlineſs</hi> over your <hi>Pariſhes,</hi> as ever the Pope did over
the <hi>whole Church?</hi> And in another place, he ſaith, they were made the
<hi>Engines</hi> of the <hi>Popiſh Conclave,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they intended to
overthrow this <hi>Church</hi> by <hi>our own folly,</hi> which they cannot
compaſs by all <hi>their policy.</hi> And Archbiſhop <hi>Grindal</hi> in a
Letter of his, called <hi>Fair warning,</hi> part the ſecond, expreſſed
his great fear of two things, <hi>Atheiſm</hi> and <hi>Popery,</hi> and both
ariſing out of our <hi>needleſs Diviſions and Diſſentions,</hi>
fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by <hi>Satan</hi> the enemy of <hi>Mankind,</hi> and the
<hi>Pope</hi> the enemy of <hi>Chriſtendome.</hi> By theſe
<hi>differences</hi> the enemies of our <hi>Religion</hi> gain this, that
nothing can be eſtabliſhed by <hi>Law</hi> in the <hi>Proteſtant
Religion,</hi> whoſe every part is not oppoſed by <hi>one or other</hi> of
our own <hi>Profeſſors.</hi> So that things continuing <hi>looſe</hi> and
<hi>confuſed,</hi> the <hi>Papiſts</hi> have their oportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to urge
their <hi>Way,</hi> which is attended with <hi>Order</hi> and
<hi>Government,</hi> and <hi>our Religion</hi> continuing thus
<hi>diſtracted</hi> and <hi>divided,</hi> ſome <hi>vile wretches</hi> lay
hold of the Arguments on <pb n="38" facs="tcp:101057:28"/>
               <hi>one ſide,</hi> to
<hi>confute the other,</hi> and ſo hope at laſt to <hi>deſtroy</hi>
all.</p>
            <p>In theſe <hi>practices</hi> our <hi>Diſſenters</hi> have for
many years followed the directions of the <hi>Jeſuite Contzen,</hi> for
inducing <hi>Popery</hi> into a Country; as 1. <hi>That it be done under a
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of eaſe to tender Conſciences.</hi> 2. <hi>That when liberty is
granted, then the parties be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid to contend with each other.</hi> 3.
<hi>That thoſe who ſuſpect the deſign, and preach againſt it, be
traduced as men that preach very unſeaſonable Doctrine; that they are
proud, and ſelf-opinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and enemies to peace and union.</hi> 4. <hi>That
the Prince make as much uſe of the diviſions of his enemies, as of the
agreement of his friends.</hi> All which <hi>Rules</hi> have been obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the <hi>Enemies</hi> of our Church, as well <hi>Diſſenters</hi> as
<hi>Romiſh Recuſants.</hi>

            <p>In the year 1588. the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereto
incouraged by an information of the great <hi>diviſions</hi> and
<hi>animoſities</hi> among us, by reaſon whereof he expected either a

<hi>Invincible Armado</hi> upon our Coaſts; at which time, the
<hi>Proteſtant Diſſenters,</hi> inſtead of Arming in defence of the

<hi>confidence</hi> aſſault her with <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> and <hi>Libels;</hi>
taking advantage of the <hi>times,</hi> as if they were more ready to

<hi>Majeſty,</hi> in caſe their <hi>unreaſonable requeſts</hi> were not
<hi>granted.</hi> Of which ſee Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> in his Annals,
<hi>Anno</hi> 1588.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding all the ſervice that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Jewel</hi>
had done againſt the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> upon his preaching a Sermon at St.
<hi>Pauls Croſs</hi> in defence of the <hi>Orders of this Church,</hi> and
<hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to them;</hi> he was ſo <hi>ungratefully</hi> and
<hi>ſpitefully</hi> uſed by the <hi>then Diſſenters,</hi> that for his
own <hi>vindication,</hi> he made a ſolemn Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation on his
<hi>death-bed,</hi> that what he then ſaid, was neither to <hi>pleaſe
ſome,</hi> nor to <hi>diſpleaſe others,</hi> but <hi>to promote peace and
unity among Brethren.</hi> Of which Archbiſhop <hi>Whitgift</hi> in his
<hi>Defence, p.</hi> 423. ſaith: <hi>It is the manner, except you pleaſe
their humour in all things. though you otherwiſe deſerve never ſo well,
all is nothing with them, but they will deprave you, rail on you, back-bite
you, invent lies of you, and ſpread falſe rumors; as though you were the

            <p>The <hi>Queen</hi> alſo is reported by <hi>theſe
Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> to be a greater <hi>friend</hi> to the <hi>Papiſts</hi> than
to her <hi>Proteſtant Subjects,</hi> though her deſign was only to keep up
the Church in ſome <hi>decency</hi> and <hi>ſplendour,</hi> the better to
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in due <hi>obedience.</hi> For by her
Inſtructions to Secretary <hi>Walſingham, Aug.</hi> 11. 1570. ſhe
affirms, <hi>That the heads of the Romiſh party did ordinarily reſort from
the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of her Reign to Divine Service in the Church, without ſhew of
miſ-liking.</hi> And Sir <hi>Ed. Cook</hi> in his Charge at <hi>Norwich</hi>
1605. ſays, <hi>they did ſo during the ten firſt years of her Reign:</hi>
and it is acknowledged by ſome <hi>late Diſſenters, p.</hi> 64. of their
Reply to Doctor <hi>Stillingfleet, That the great propenſion in the Queen to
gain the Popiſh party to her Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion by the alterations made in the
Liturgie, making the Sacramental bread round like the wafers, placing the Table
where the Altar ſtood,</hi> 
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:101057:29"/>&amp;c. <hi>was attended with
the Conformity of many who were cordially addicted to the Church of</hi> Rome.
So that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſeemed to have a better opinion of the
<hi>Reformation,</hi> than ſome <hi>Proteſtants</hi> then or now have; and
though the <hi>preſent Church</hi> hath laid aſide ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of thoſe things,
which were then enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and practiſed, retaining only <hi>three
Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies</hi> for <hi>decency,</hi> yet the implacable ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of their
<hi>Succeſſors,</hi> ſtill reviles the Church, as making <hi>nearer
approches</hi> to <hi>Popery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By theſe <hi>inſolent proceedings,</hi> both of
<hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh</hi> and other <hi>Separatiſts,</hi> the Queen was
neceſſitated to paſs <hi>both thoſe Acts,</hi> of the 23 and 35 of her
Raign, <hi>to retain her Subjects in due Obedience,</hi> which equally
reſpect all the <hi>diſſenting Parties;</hi> and by a <hi>juſt
executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of thoſe and other good Laws upon ſome <hi>principal
Offenders</hi> of all ſides, the <hi>ſtorms</hi> which they had raiſed
were <hi>prevented:</hi> which is well obſerved by Dr <hi>Burnet,</hi> in his
Preface to his Second Volume, <hi>That her ſtrict en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity,
making ſome turbulent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons examples, countenancing the Clergie,
e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially the Archbiſhop</hi> Whitgift, <hi>and the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity and
watchfulneſs of the Council and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Officers, preſerved the Nation
in peace all her days.</hi> (And he adds) <hi>If her Succeſſors had held
the reins of Government with like ſteadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of hand, the Nation, how
headſtrong ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, <pb n="42" facs="tcp:101057:30"/>could never have run into thoſe
deſperate confuſions, from which nothing but the hand of God could have
redeemed us.</hi> N. B.</p>
            <p>But to bring home my diſcourſe to <hi>our times,</hi> and to
the <hi>intended deſign,</hi> which is to ſhew, that the Riſe of thoſe
<hi>Wars</hi> which have been lately among us, was from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy between

whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they ſuggeſted, that their <hi>Religion</hi> was in

<hi>Epiſcopacy:</hi> And ſo they enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a <hi>Covenant for defence of

            <p>This <hi>Letter</hi> was diſcovered, and brought to the King,
and was proved to be the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing of <hi>Loudon,</hi> who, being in
<hi>London,</hi> was committed to the Tower; and on examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion confeſſed
it to be his hand: but excuſed the matter, becauſe it was written
<hi>before the Pacification.</hi> However, they had really en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged Cardinal
<hi>Richlien,</hi> who governed the <pb n="44" facs="tcp:101057:31"/>affairs of
<hi>France.</hi> He ſent one <hi>Chamberline</hi> his Chaplain, a
<hi>Scot</hi> by birth, to aſſiſt the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanters,</hi> and to
attempt all ways for <hi>exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating</hi> the <hi>firſt heats;</hi> with
order not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part till he might return with <hi>good news.</hi> He appointed
one of his Secretaries alſo to reſide in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and to march
with them into <hi>England,</hi> to be preſent at the <hi>Council of
War,</hi> and <hi>direct</hi> their buſineſs. <hi>Hamilton</hi>'s Chaplain
alſo had free acceſs unto <hi>Con</hi> the <hi>Popes Nuncio,</hi> and a
<hi>Scotch-man,</hi> then in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> on the ſame deſigne.</p>
            <p>And if Mr. <hi>Ruſhworth</hi> the Parliaments Hiſtorian may be
credited, there were alſo <hi>at that time</hi> ſome Applications made to
the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who was <hi>then</hi> the <hi>moſt potent
Monarch.</hi> For, <hi>p.</hi> 970, &amp; 971. he ſays. That <hi>in the
year</hi> 1639, <hi>when the Spaniſh Armado came on the Coaſts of</hi>
England, Scotland <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then in a great ferment by the Covenanters, ſome
of them thus argued: That there could be no Fleet ſtrong enough to attempt
them by Sea, except all the Kingdom did contribute to it; which, ſay they,
cannot be done, except all the States joyn; of which we of the Confederacy
ſhall be the greater part: and ſo the Enemy ſhall be forthwith forced to
give liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to the Catholicks, or put themſelves in danger
of loſing all.</hi> From whence it is col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, 1. That the <hi>Scots</hi>
thought no Enemies <pb n="45" facs="tcp:101057:31"/>ſo great, as the <hi>King</hi> and
<hi>his Party.</hi> 2. That <hi>liberty of Conſcience</hi> was deſired for
the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> as well as <hi>themſelves.</hi> 3. That the
<hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanters</hi> thought themſelves the <hi>greater part</hi> of the
<hi>States.</hi> And 4. That there was a <hi>ſecret Confederacy</hi> between
<hi>them</hi> and the <hi>Papiſts;</hi> and this <hi>Armado</hi> was
deſigned for <hi>their aſſiſtance.</hi> And as for the King of
<hi>Great Britain,</hi> the Relator ſays, <hi>If he will not give liberty of
Conſcience, he ſhall be reduced to it with no little damage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for <hi>Argyle,</hi> whoſe <hi>Father</hi> was a <hi>known
Papiſt,</hi> I ſuppoſe he was as much of <hi>that</hi> as of <hi>any
Religion,</hi> though he were the <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Covenanters:</hi>
his <hi>intereſt</hi> was his <hi>Religion,</hi> as <hi>this Action</hi> of
his doth demonſtrate. His Father left a ſecond Wife, by whoſe laſt Will
there was given to the Daughters 12000<abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> ſterling; and
<hi>Argyle</hi> prevailed to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Adminiſtrator, he giving ſecurity
to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Will: but ſhortly after he cauſed the eldeſt, whoſe
Portion was 5000<abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> to marry a Gentleman who accepted
onely 1000<abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> with her; which was paid by
<hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyle</hi>'s Surety, and not repayed to this day, ſaith my Author. As
to the other Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, there was a clauſe in the Will, <hi>That if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of
them ſhould enter into Nunneries,</hi> (for it ſeems they were inclinable
to the <hi>Popiſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>) <hi>they ſhould have onely</hi>
300<abbr>l.</abbr> And <pb n="46" facs="tcp:101057:32"/>being defrauded of their <hi>due
Maintenance,</hi> two of them did enter into <hi>Nunneries;</hi> and the third,
through his neglect, was ready to do the like. But <hi>the Covenanter cared for
none of theſe things.</hi> See the <hi>Hiſtory of Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency,</hi>
Appendix, <hi>p.</hi> 7. Nor was <hi>Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> whom the King intruſted
as his <hi>Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioner</hi> in that Kingdom, free from a <hi>ſhrewd
ſuſpicion</hi> of correſponding with the <hi>Papiſts</hi> his Chaplain
making frequent Applications to <hi>Con</hi> the Popes <hi>Nuntio,</hi> by whom
he was commended as a man <hi>fit for his purpoſe;</hi> as ſhall appear in
the diſcovery made by Sir <hi>Will. Boſwell;</hi> of which hereafter.</p>
            <p>The <hi>King,</hi> during the <hi>interval of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
which was for thirteen years, reſolved on a Journy to <hi>Scotland,</hi> to
be there <hi>crowned</hi> He had requeſted that the <hi>Crown</hi> might be
ſent into <hi>England,</hi> to ſave that Journy; but the
<hi>Covenanters</hi> and <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſent word they durſt not do it.
Marqueſs <hi>Huntly,</hi> who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a <hi>Toleration</hi> of
<hi>Popery</hi> there, told the Council there, <hi>When his Majeſty ſhall
come and be crowned here, he will no doubt be ſworn to our Laws: mean while,
ſeeing he hath intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted us with them, we will look they ſhall be
ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</hi> And both <hi>Papiſt</hi> and <hi>Covenanter</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to
tell the <hi>King,</hi> that <hi>ſhould he long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer that duty, they might
perhaps be inclined to make choice of another King.</hi> The King 
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:101057:32"/>therefore goes into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and is crowned with
great ſolemnity. But being there, he makes a <hi>revocation</hi> of ſuch
<hi>Lands</hi> as had been taken from the <hi>Crown</hi> in his Fathers
mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>And by the foreſaid Commiſſion of <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendries</hi>
(upon a <hi>Petition</hi> of many of the <hi>Gentry, Miniſtry,</hi> and
<hi>Commons</hi>) he frees the <hi>Miniſters</hi> and <hi>People</hi> from
the <hi>Vaſſalage</hi> of ſome <hi>great men</hi> that had ingroſſed
the <hi>Tythes</hi> of the Nation, allowing the <hi>Miniſters</hi> onely an
inconſiderable <hi>Penſion,</hi> keeping the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of the People in
<hi>dependance</hi> on them, and ſo <hi>oppreſſing</hi> them, that no one
durſt car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry home his <hi>nine parts</hi> until the
<hi>Lay-Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priator</hi> had houſed his <hi>Tenth.</hi> For this the King
received great <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Thanks</hi> from the greateſt part of
the Nation; but the <hi>Lords that were concerned,</hi> cauſed it to be
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported abroad, that this was done to the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice</hi> of their
<hi>Religion,</hi> and to make greater proviſion for the <hi>power</hi> and
<hi>ſplendour</hi> of <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops:</hi> and from this time they
confederate againſt the <hi>King,</hi> and provide for a <hi>Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Et

            </p>
            <p>In the laſt Parliament called by King <hi>James, Feb.</hi> 19.
there was, as the King called it, <hi>a ſtinging Petition</hi> preſented
againſt the <hi>Papiſts;</hi> on which the King ſpake thus: <hi>It 
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:101057:33"/>hath been talked of my remiſneſs in Religion, and a
ſuſpicion of a Toleration; but as God ſhall judge me, I never thought, or
in word expreſſed any thing that ſavoured of it. It is true, that for
reaſons beſt known to my ſelf, I did at times forbear the execution of
the Laws, which might have hindred more weighty affairs,</hi> &amp;c. The King
therefore conſented, 1. <hi>That all Jeſuits and Seminary Prieſts, having
taken Orders from the See of</hi> Rome, <hi>be forthwith commanded to depart
out of his Majeſties Dominions. and not to return under the penalty of the
Laws now in force; and that none harbour or conceal them.</hi> 2. <hi>That all
Armour and Ammunition be taken from them.</hi> 3. <hi>That all Papiſts be
confined within five miles of their Dwelling-houſes, and come not within ten
miles of</hi> London, <hi>or the Kings or Princes Court.</hi> 4. <hi>That all
Subjects be reſtrained from hearing Maſs, or other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of Romiſh
Religion, in the houſes of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Embaſſadours.</hi> 5. <hi>That none
be intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted as Juſtices of the Peace, Lord-Lieutenants, Deputies,
Captains,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>who reſort not to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine-Service.</hi> 6.
<hi>That the Laws made againſt Recuſants be put in execution, and not
ſlacken them on any Treaty of Marriage, or otherwiſe with any forreign
Princes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To theſe the King anſwered, <hi>I cannot but commend your Zeal
in offering this Petition; yet I hold my ſelf unfortunate, that I am thought 
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:101057:33"/>to need a Spur to do that which my Conſcience and Duty
bind me to. What Religion I am of, my Books, my Profeſſion and Behaviour
declare: and I wiſh it may be written in Marble, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main as a Mark on me
to poſterity, when I ſhall ſwerve from my Religion: for he that doth
diſſemble with God, is not to be truſted by men. The increaſe of Popery
hath been my grief; and my endeavour hath been to prevent it: and if I have not
been a Martyr, I have been a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor, though I have been far from
proſecution— I therefore grant your Petition, That all Prieſts and
Jeſuits depart at a day; and will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand my Judges to put the Laws in
execution againſt them; I will reſtrain the reſort to Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours
houſes, and provide for the educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Popiſh Children: for it is a
ſhame they ſhould be brought up here, as if they were at</hi> Rome. <hi>And
aſſure your ſelves, I ſhall never hearken to the interceſſion of
foreign Princes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Laws.</hi> Hereupon many <hi>Noblemen</hi> and
<hi>others</hi> that were in places of <hi>truſt,</hi> were put out. So that
King <hi>James</hi> could not be ſuſpected of <hi>Popery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the firſt year of King <hi>Charles,</hi> a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being
called, <hi>June</hi> 18. a <hi>Petition</hi> of the like nature is
preſented; to which the King anſwered, <hi>That he was glad of their

with them.</hi> The <hi>particulars</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <pb n="50" facs="tcp:101057:34"/>like

                  <p>LEt not a damp of Aſtoniſhment ſeize on your ardent
ſoul, in apprehending the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and unexpected calling of a Parliament:
we have not oppoſed, but rather further it; ſo that we hope as much in this
Parliament, as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver we feared any in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s days. You
muſt know, the Council is engaged to aſſiſt the King by way of
Prerogative, in caſe the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary way ſhould fail. You ſhall ſee
this Parliament will reſemble the Pelican, which takes a pleaſure to dig
out with its beak her <pb n="52" facs="tcp:101057:35"/>own Bowels. The elections of Knights
and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes have been in ſuch confuſion of apparent Faction, as that
which we were wont to procure heretofore with much Art and Induſtry, when the
Spaniſh Match was in treaty. Now it breaks out as naturally as a Botch or
Boil, and ſpits and ſpews out its own rancour and venome. You re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member how
that famous and immortal States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Count <hi>Gundamor</hi> fed King
<hi>James</hi>'s fancy, and rock'd him aſleep with the ſoft and ſweet
ſound of Peace, to keep up the Spaniſh Treaty: he had but one principal
means to further the great deſigne, which was, to ſet on King
<hi>James</hi> that none but the Puritan Faction, which plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Anarchy and
his Confuſion, were averſe to this moſt happy <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion. We ſteered on
the ſame courſe, and have made great uſe of this Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical Election,
and have prejudicated and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipated the Great One, that none but the Kings
Enemies and his are choſen of this Parliament, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We have now
many Strings to our Bow, and have ſtrongly fortified our Faction, and have
added two Bulworks more. For when King <hi>James</hi> lived, you know he was
very vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent againſt <hi>Arminianiſm,</hi> and interrupted with his
peſtilent Wit and deep Learning our ſtrong deſignes in <hi>Holland,</hi>
and was a great friend to that old Rebel and Heretick the Prince of
<hi>Orange.</hi> Now we have planted the Soveraign Drug <hi>Arminianiſm,</hi>
which we hope <pb n="53" facs="tcp:101057:35"/>will purge the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> from
their Hereſie; and it flouriſheth, and bears fruit in due ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. The
Materials which build up our Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, are the Projectors and Beggars of all
ranks and qualities; to deſtroy the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to introduce a new
ſpecies and form of Government, which is <hi>Oligarchy:</hi> Theſe ſerve
as direct <hi>Mediums</hi> and Inſtruments to our end, which is the
univerſal Catholick Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy. Our foundation muſt be Mutation, and
Mutation will cauſe a Relaxation; which will ſerve as ſo many violent
Diſeaſes (as the Stone, Gout, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) to the ſpeedy
deſtruction of our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual and inſufferable anguiſh of body, which is
worſe than death it ſelf. We proceed now with counſel, and mature
deliberation, how and when to work on the Dukes jealouſie and revenge; and in
this we give the honour to thoſe which merit it, which are the
Church-Catholicks. There is another matter of conſequence which we take much
into our conſideration and tender care, which is, to ſtave off the
Puritans, that they hang not on the Dukes ears: they are impudent ſubtile
people, and it is to be feared leſt they ſhould negotiate a Reconciliation
between the Duke and the Parliament. It is certain the Duke would gladly have
reconciled himſelf to the Parliament at <hi>Oxford</hi> and
<hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> but now we aſſure our ſelves we have ſo
handled the matter, that both Duke and Parliament are ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconcilable. 
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:101057:36"/>For the better prevention of the Puritans, the Arminians
have already lock'd up the Dukes ears; and we have thoſe of our own Religion,
which ſtand continually at the Dukes Chamber-door, to ſee who goes in and
out. We cannot be too careful and circumſpect in this regard. I cannot
chuſe but laugh, to ſee how ſome of our Coat have accoutred themſelves;
you would ſcarce know them, if you ſaw them; and 'tis admirable how in
ſpeech and geſture they act the Puritans. The <hi>Cambridge</hi>-Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
to their woful experience, ſhall ſee we can act the Puritans a little
better than they have done the Jeſuits. They have abuſed our ſacred
Patron <hi>Ignatius</hi> in jeſt; but we will make them ſmart in earneſt.
I hope you will excuſe my merry digreſſion: for I confeſs to you, I am
at this time tranſported with joy, to ſee how hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily all inſtruments
and means, as well great as leſs, cooperate to our purpoſes,

            <p>After the diſſolution of the Parliament, <hi>Anno</hi> 1628,
ſome <hi>refractory Members</hi> were ſent for to the
<hi>Council-Table;</hi> Mr. <hi>Hollis,</hi> Sir <hi>John Elliot,</hi> Sir
<hi>Miles Hobart,</hi> Sir <hi>Peter Hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> Sir <hi>Jo. Barrington,</hi>
Mr <hi>Selden,</hi> Mr. <hi>Stroud</hi> another of the five Members, Mr.
<hi>Correton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Valentine,</hi> Mr. <hi>Long,</hi> Mr. <hi>Kirton.
Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi> was queſtioned, <hi>Why on the day the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was
diſſolved, he placed himſelf next the <pb n="55" facs="tcp:101057:36"/>Speakers
Chair.</hi> He anſwered, <hi>That he had ſeated himſelf there formerly,
and took it his due to be there, as in any place whatſoever,</hi> (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
at the Council-Table, to ſit above thoſe Privy-Counſellors): <hi>That he
came into the Houſe with as good intention to ſerve his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty as any
other; yet finding his Majeſty offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, he humbly deſired to be the
Subject rather of his Majeſties mercy than his power.</hi> The Lord
Treaſurer replied, <hi>You mean, rather of his Majeſties mercy than his
juſtice. I ſay</hi> (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Hollis</hi>) <hi>of his Majeſties
power, my Lord. Hobart</hi>'s offence was for <hi>locking the Parliaments
doors, and putting the Key in his pocket.</hi> Which (he ſaid) <hi>was the
command of the Houſe.</hi> The reſt were queſtioned for <hi>reproving
the</hi> Speaker <hi>when he came to do the Kings command.</hi> To which they
pleaded <hi>Priviledge of Parliament.</hi> But they were all impriſoned, and
fined at the Kings-bench-bar, and gave 2000<abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> ſecurity
for good behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. But this was the <hi>firſt Seed</hi> which took
<hi>root</hi> in <hi>Parliament,</hi> and brought forth <hi>bitter Fruits.</hi>
And theſe things <hi>manent altâ mente repoſta.</hi> For,</p>
            <p>Before the calling of the <hi>long Parliament</hi> in 41, the
<hi>factious Party,</hi> who were <hi>diſappointed</hi> in the <hi>former
Parliament,</hi> and had been que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned for their <hi>inſolencies,</hi>
kept together in a <hi>ſecret Committee</hi> in <hi>London;</hi> foreſeeing

affairs</hi> would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire <hi>another Parliament.</hi> For they had ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
the <hi>Scots</hi> to an <hi>Inſurrection,</hi> with whom they had
<hi>conſtant correſpondence;</hi> for which his Majeſty charged the
<hi>five Members</hi> at the beginning of that Parliament, having

ſeveral Counties, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the <hi>Election</hi> of ſuch perſons as

and upon promiſes of <hi>reforming</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> and
<hi>redreſſing Grievances</hi> in the <hi>State,</hi> they prevailed in

Perſwaſion.</hi> That which added both <hi>fuel</hi> and <hi>fire</hi> to
that <hi>flame</hi> which in time cauſed a <hi>general Conflagration</hi> of
the three Nations, was the zeal of ſome <hi>popular</hi> and <hi>factious
Preachers,</hi> whoſe Pulpit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

about forty Doctors of Divinity, and many hundreds of <hi>learned</hi> and
<hi>grave Divines,</hi> for no other crime but their <hi>Loyalty</hi> and
<hi>good Benefices;</hi> of which a Treatiſe called <hi>Perſecutio
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndecima,</hi> gives a particular account: againſt whom the chief Articles
were, for preaching <hi>Obedience to the King,</hi> againſt
<hi>Sacriledge</hi> and <hi>Rebellion,</hi> and for keeping their
Pariſh-Churches; for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the <hi>Liturgie,</hi> and <hi>bowing</hi> at
the Name of <hi>Jeſus;</hi> for <hi>having Popiſh Books,</hi> or being
<hi>ſeen</hi> in the <hi>company of Papiſts.</hi> Inſomuch as Mr.
<hi>Selden,</hi> one of their Members, ſaid to a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of
<hi>Honour,</hi> That <hi>Learning</hi> and <hi>Honeſty</hi> were ſins
enough in a <hi>Clergie-man,</hi> to <hi>undo</hi> him. The reputation of being
<hi>Popiſh Prieſts,</hi> or but <hi>Caeſar's Friends,</hi> was crime
e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. <pb n="58" facs="tcp:101057:38"/>One Mr. <hi>White</hi> publiſhed his
<hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies</hi> of <hi>ſequeſtred</hi> and <hi>ejected
Miniſters,</hi> lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their charge ſuch things as were never attempted
to be proved againſt them. And it was obſerved at that time, that he was
greatly troubled in Conſcience for abuſing and ruining ſo many
Clergy-men, and died in a diſtracted condition: which hitherto I have not
ſeen or heard to be contradicted. Certain it is, that none of them had any
one point of <hi>Popery</hi> proved againſt them. The Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi>
accuſed Dr. <hi>Coſens,</hi> then Vice-chancellor of <hi>Cambridge,</hi>
that he had perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a young man to <hi>Popery:</hi> but upon exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
it was found that he had <hi>expelled</hi> the perſon that perverted him from
the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity; and ſome who were then <hi>Members of the Parliament,</hi>
teſtified as much in behalf of the Doctor. Whereupon, after ſome weeks
impriſonment, he was ſet free; and no man gave better proof of his
averſion to <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,</hi> both in the time of his <hi>exile,</hi> and
after his <hi>return,</hi> than that <hi>eminent Doctor</hi> did. So unhappy
have the <hi>Fanatick Party</hi> always been, to impeach them moſt as being
<hi>Popiſhly inclined,</hi> who have given the greateſt demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of
their <hi>oppoſition</hi> to <hi>it.</hi> But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn:</p>
            <p>If they wanted any <hi>numbers</hi> to <hi>petition</hi> for what
they had in deſigne, or any <hi>money</hi> to <pb n="59" facs="tcp:101057:38"/>begin the
Wars; Mr. <hi>Pym</hi> and ſome other of the <hi>five Members,</hi> were
ſent into the <hi>City;</hi> who in conjunction with ſome <hi>eminent
Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,</hi> ſuch as Mr. <hi>Marſhal, Calamy,</hi> &amp;c. by their
<hi>long Speeches</hi> and <hi>fair pretences, decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the hearts,</hi> and
<hi>opened the purſes</hi> of the <hi>deluded people.</hi> From hence came
thoſe <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults</hi> that <hi>petitioned againſt</hi> the
<hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Popiſh Lords,</hi> and for the bringing the
<hi>Earl of Strafford</hi> and the <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> to their Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als. The
good Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> ſaid, <hi>He never knew but one
Biſhop,</hi> (viz. Biſhop <hi>Williams,</hi> who betrayed his <hi>Lord</hi>
and <hi>Maſter</hi>) <hi>that ſtood for the good of the Commonwealth.</hi>
As for the reſt, Mr. <hi>Nathaniel Fiennes</hi> made a large Speech, to
ſhew that <hi>Epiſcopacy was an Enemy to Monarchy:</hi> whereas his Father
ſpoke and printed to the contrary, <hi>That the Biſhops were too much
devoted to the King.</hi> And the young Gentleman was (not long after) condemed
by Martial Law.</p>
            <p>Now that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> had a great hand in our
<hi>Troubles at home</hi> (as well as in <hi>Scotland</hi>) doth clearly appear
from the Teſtimony of Sir <hi>Edward Cooke,</hi> and <hi>other
Tranſactions</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mentioned. But it will yet more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appear,
that the Popiſh Party were chief Agents in animating the Engliſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels,
with whom they held correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to that end, by the diſcovery made to 
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:101057:39"/>Sir <hi>W. Boſwel</hi> by one <hi>Andreas ab
Habernfield,</hi> and communicated to the Archbiſhop, <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi> 6.
1640. Which Relation Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> found among the Archbiſhops Papers,
and cauſed it to be printed by Order of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of the Houſe of
Commons. Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> urgeth <hi>many Arguments</hi> to evince the
<hi>truth</hi> of that Plot, and ſays, That <hi>not onely he, but the
Parliament, as well as the King and Archbiſhop, did believe it;</hi> and
<hi>that he muſt be a Monſter of incredulity that doth not believe
it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>particulars</hi> of the <hi>diſcovery</hi> that are
moſt to our purpoſe, are as follow: 
<list>
                  <item>1. That the Diſcoverer was bred a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> and
an <hi>Eccleſiaſtick,</hi> and judged a fit perſon to be Coadjutor to
<hi>Con</hi> the Popes <hi>Nuntio,</hi> by Cardinal <hi>Barbarino,</hi> who
under the Pope was made <hi>Preſident of the Congregation of Jeſuits
in</hi> England, <hi>for propagation of Religion.</hi> But the horrour of this
<hi>Plot,</hi> which was to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the <hi>King</hi> and the
<hi>Archbiſhop,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve three Nations in <hi>Bloud,</hi> ſo
<hi>troubled his Conſcience,</hi> that he not onely diſcovered the
<hi>Plot,</hi> but forſook the <hi>Religion</hi> that allowed of ſuch
bloudy practices.</item>
                  <item>2. That from <hi>Con</hi> he received and diſpat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched all
the <hi>intelligence</hi> concerning the <hi>Plot,</hi> which was communicated
to <hi>Con</hi> from a <hi>Conſult</hi> of <hi>political Jeſuits</hi> which
met private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Province of <hi>Wales.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:101057:39"/>
                  <item>3. That there were at leaſt fifty <hi>Scotiſh
Jeſuits</hi> at that time in and about <hi>London.</hi> That one
<hi>Maxwell</hi> a <hi>Scotiſh Earl</hi> and <hi>Papiſt,</hi> was ſent
into <hi>Scotland</hi> by the <hi>Popiſh Party,</hi> with whom two other
<hi>Scotiſh Earls</hi> were Correſpondents; whoſe buſineſs it was to
<hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite</hi> the <hi>Scots</hi> to a <hi>Rebellion,</hi> by aggravating the
Actions of the <hi>Engliſh Court,</hi> particularly the puniſhment of
<hi>Prynne, Burton,</hi> and <hi>Baſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi> and the impoſing of the
<hi>Engliſh Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie</hi> on them.</item>
                  <item>4. That a Chaplain of <hi>Hamiltons</hi> (the Kings
Commiſſioner) had often <hi>ſecret con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference</hi> with <hi>Con:</hi>
concerning whom, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former asking merrily whether the <hi>Jews</hi> alſo
agreed with the <hi>Samaritans, Con</hi> replied, <hi>I would to God all
Miniſters were like him.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>5. That Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> ſent Mr. <hi>Tho.
Chamberlain</hi> his Chaplain and Almoner, to whom a Biſhoprick was
promiſed, into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> who tarried there four months, and was not
to return till he brought good news.</item>
                  <item>6. That Sir <hi>Toby Matthews</hi> a <hi>politick
Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit,</hi> did diligently enquire, and tranſmit In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence to
<hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>7. That in the houſe of one Capt. <hi>Read</hi> was a
conſtant <hi>meeting</hi> of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> every
<hi>Poſt-day,</hi> where they received <hi>Letters</hi> from <hi>Rome,</hi>
and made returns in <hi>feigned names.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:101057:40"/>
                  <item>8. That Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> and <hi>Windebank,</hi> the
Lord <hi>Arundel</hi> and his Counteſs, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs of
<hi>Buckingham,</hi> and others, were privy to the <hi>Plot,</hi> and betrayed
the <hi>Kings Counſels.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the whole, Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> makes theſe remarks:
<hi>That the Conſpirators have almost brought their deſigne to maturity. to
our ſhame and grief, by new-raiſed Civil Wars, both in</hi> England
<hi>and</hi> Ireland, (but he adds not a word of <hi>Scotland</hi>): <hi>That
Secretary</hi> Winde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bank, <hi>and Captain</hi> Read, <hi>with ſome others,
went ſecretly into</hi> Ireland <hi>to raiſe a Rebellion there; who
aſſured them that there would be ſuch Broils in</hi> England, <hi>that no
Force could be ſent thence.</hi> But not a word yet of what was done in
<hi>Scotland,</hi> where they were in <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Arms</hi> againſt the
<hi>King,</hi> and ceaſed not till they had effected the <hi>death</hi> of
the <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop</hi> and the <hi>King,</hi> as this <hi>diſcovery</hi>
had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told.</p>
            <p>I ſhall adde an Obſervation of <hi>Hammond L'Eſtrange. The
Presbyterian Party</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>were not the onely men in the
Conſpiracy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> for in caſe
of general diſturbances, nothing i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> more familiar than for ſeveral Factions of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
inclinations and intereſts to unite, aiming at their own ſeveral ends.</hi>
And a foul <hi>blemiſh</hi> it would have been to the <hi>Society of
Jeſus,</hi> ſhould they have ſate ſtill in a work ſo <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to
their Employment,</hi> as theſe Scotiſh <pb n="63" facs="tcp:101057:40"/>Broils: Though
they did not reach at the <hi>external glory</hi> of the Enterprize, which they
rendred to the <hi>Presbyterians;</hi> yet were they as diligent in their
Machinations as poſſibly they could be, hoping to be <hi>greateſt gainers
at laſt.</hi> But the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> had done their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, having
ſet their <hi>Journey-men</hi> at work both in <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Scotland;</hi> and they were ready as <hi>Auxiliaries</hi> to aſſiſt
them: to which end they <hi>mix themſelves</hi> with the <hi>Councils</hi>
and <hi>Armies</hi> both of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi>
obſtructing all <hi>Overtures</hi> and <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> of Peace. It was
not for any love to the <hi>King</hi> or his <hi>Cauſe,</hi> that ſome few
of them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged with his Party, but to help on the <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Calamity</hi>
of the <hi>two Nations,</hi> and to <hi>keep on</hi> the Wars, that they might
raiſe themſelves on the <hi>ruines</hi> of <hi>both Parties.</hi> For, that
there were more <hi>Papiſts</hi> engaged with the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>-Armies
than the <hi>King's,</hi> appears by his Majeſties Declaration after the
Fight at <hi>Edg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill,</hi> Oct. 1643. <hi>All men know the great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of
Papiſts Commanders and others that ſerve in their Armies, the great
induſtry they uſed to corrupt the Loyalty and affection of Our loving
Subjests of that Religion, the private promiſes and undertakings that they
made if they would aſſiſt them against <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s; all the Laws made in their
prejudice ſhould be repealed; when nothing could prevail with <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s to invite 
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:101057:41"/>them to Our Succour, or recal Our Proclamation which forbad
them ſo to do. We know that a far greater number of Papiſts are in their
Army than Our own.</hi> And one <hi>Robert de Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monet</hi> a <hi>Popiſh
Prieſt</hi> and <hi>Scotiſh man,</hi> who wrote a Hiſtory of our Wars in
French, ſaith of this Fight, <hi>That which moſt ſurpriſed every one,
was, that they found among the dead at</hi> Edge-hill <hi>ſeveral Popiſh
Prieſts:</hi> For although in their <hi>Declarations</hi> they called the
Kings Army a <hi>Popiſh Army,</hi> to render it odious; yet they had in their
Army <hi>two Companies of Walloons,</hi> and other <hi>Roman Catholicks.</hi>
And they omitted no endeavours to ingage Sir <hi>Arthur Aſhton,</hi> an
eminent <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,</hi> to their party.</p>
            <p>In Mr. <hi>Prynnes</hi> Relation of the Tryal of the
<hi>Archbiſhop,</hi> one Mr. <hi>Chaloner</hi> was produced, who depoſed,
that he being at <hi>Bruxels,</hi> and diſcourſing with an <hi>Engliſh
Traveller,</hi> heard him to affirm, that <hi>Popery</hi> would be brought into
<hi>England,</hi> and the Introducers ſhould be the <hi>Proteſtants
themſelves:</hi> whereat when he wondred, the Gentleman told him, that
<hi>the War ſhould be ſo diſguiſed under falſe notions and pretences,
as that the Proteſtants ſhould ignorantly become the Jeſuits ſervants,
and by the effuſion of their own blood ſet up Popery, p.</hi> 415. And
becauſe Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> mentioned ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſent into
<hi>Ireland,</hi> to ſtir up the Rebellion <pb n="65" facs="tcp:101057:41"/>there, I
ſhall mention alſo that which the King ſays of it in his <hi>Chapter</hi>
of that <hi>Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion: I believe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it will at laſt
appear, that they who firſt began to embroil my other Kingdoms, are in great
part guilty if not of the firſt letting out, yet of the not timely ſtopping
thoſe horrid effuſions of blood in</hi> Ireland. And it was obſerved,
that when the Deſign againſt the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> as alſo
againſt the <hi>King,</hi> was managing, there was a great cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence
between the Leaders of <hi>both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> in <hi>Ireland;</hi> of which the
Author of <hi>the Hiſtory of Independencie</hi> gives ſo large an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
that I ſhall only ſelect <hi>ſome paſſages,</hi> and refer the
<hi>Reader</hi> to ſee the whole Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action at his leaſure, in the
<hi>Hiſtory of Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency,</hi> p. 150, 198, p. 230. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
245.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall firſt inſert that which the <hi>Royal

imbroyling thoſe two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and proceeding ſucceſsfully in the

following tranſactions, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Parliament</hi> and <hi>Cromwel,</hi>
are a more clear evidence of an actual conjunction with the <hi>Iriſh
Rebels</hi> againſt the King.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>John Temple</hi> was of the Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil in
<hi>Ireland,</hi> at the Inſurrection and after; a perſon that thought
himſelf <hi>diſobliged</hi> by the <hi>King,</hi> a <hi>Parliament</hi>-man
here in <hi>England,</hi> and one that too much adhered to the
<hi>Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> He is confident that the chief aim of the <hi>Iriſh</hi>
was to ſhake off the <hi>Engliſh yoke,</hi> and ſettle the power in the
<hi>Natives.</hi> One <hi>Cooke</hi> depoſed, that <hi>Tirlogh Brady</hi>
ſaid, That <hi>the Iriſh would within a fortnight have a King of their own,
p.</hi> 83. <hi>&amp;</hi> 66. <hi>p.</hi> 50, 51. The ſame was depoſed by
others. As was alſo, <hi>That they took the</hi> Scots <hi>for a preſident:
they would have the Kingdom in their own hands, Laws of their own, a Deputy of
their own, without moleſtation from another Nation,</hi> p. 19. That <hi>they
cared not for King</hi> Charles, <hi>having a King of their own.</hi> In the
Remonſtrance, <hi>p.</hi> 54. they called <hi>Tyrone</hi> their
<hi>King;</hi> and his Commiſſion, the <hi>Kings Commiſſion.</hi> They
af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the <hi>Scots</hi> to be of <hi>their ſide, p.</hi> 37. That they
had the Earl of <hi>Argyles</hi> hand, and <hi>moſt of the Nobility of</hi>
Scotland.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Macguire,</hi> a chief contriver of the <hi>Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,</hi>
falling into the <hi>Parliaments</hi> power, was much importun'd by promiſes
and threats to <pb n="69" facs="tcp:101057:43"/>diſcover <hi>whether the King were privy
to the Rebellion:</hi> but he did ſtill acquit the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>all
other Engliſh</hi> from being guilty as much as of <hi>knowing</hi> it. And
it is very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, that he did this not only while he was under a
ſentence of Condemnation; but when he had been turned off the Cart, and
recovered again after a moſt barbarous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, yet ſtill he acquitted the
King to his death, and denied that ever he ſaw any <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion</hi>
from him.</p>
            <p>And whereas the King was accuſed of granting them a
<hi>Toleration:</hi> it is true, that he was neceſſitated to <hi>offer</hi>
that, which they had <hi>forced</hi> from him before; but it was with ſuch
<hi>reſtrictions,</hi> that they liked it not, but took it on their <hi>own
terms.</hi> And indeed the <hi>King</hi> told them by one of his Secretaries;
<hi>You inſiſt on ſomething in Religion more than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly you were
contented with: I am therefore commanded to let you know, that were His
Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties condition much lower, you ſhall never force him to any further
Conceſſions, to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of his Conſcience, and of the Proteſtant
Religion, in which he is reſolved to live, and for which he is ready to dye:
and that he will joyn with any Proteſtant Prince; nay, with his Rebels at
home, rather than yield the leaſt to you in this particular.</hi> And this
was the joynt opinion of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> 
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:101057:44"/>that the King would give them all up as
a Sacrifice, to compaſs a <hi>Peace</hi> with his <hi>Parliament,</hi> though
they had been <hi>Loyal</hi> to him in his extremity.</p>
            <p>The Marqueſs of <hi>Ormond,</hi> and thoſe that acted for the
King under his Lieutenancy in <hi>Ireland,</hi> was ſo proſperous in his
endeavours to reduce that Kingdom to the obedience of the <hi>Crown,</hi> that
a <hi>Peace</hi> was made with the moſt conſiderable of the <hi>Confederate
Iriſh.</hi> But they being otherwiſe tampered with by the
<hi>Parliament-party,</hi> contrary to their Faith and promiſe, the <hi>Popes
Nuntio,</hi> and ſome <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh Clergy</hi> prevailed with the

            </p>
            <p>Of which the Author of <hi>the Hiſtory of Independency, p.</hi>
150. of the Second part, tells us in the Margent, that the <hi>Council of
Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers</hi> endeavour to joyn intereſts with the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> in
<hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland:</hi> And then ſays, <hi>The King had
offended the Papiſts in the laſt Treaty, in granting ſo much to the
Parliament for their ſuppreſſion. The Independents per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it, and
willing to joyn with any intereſt to make good their deſign, it was
propoſed at the Council of Officers, that the Papiſts ſhould raiſe and
pay Ten thouſand additional Forces for the Army; in recompence whereof, all
pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Laws concerning them ſhould be repealed, all <pb n="71" facs="tcp:101057:44"/>Taxes

ſupplyed him with Ammunition, and admitted</hi> O Rely <hi>the Popes Iriſh
Nuntio to a Treaty here in</hi> England. <hi>Sir</hi> John Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>was
taken into imployment, and the arrears of his Rent gathered for him by
Souldiers, to the regret of the Country; Sir</hi> Kenelme Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>had a

Officers with him, they do not doubt but the propoſals are already yielded to

Kingdom cannot be ſatisfied therewith till the Parliament declare more
publickly therein, he hath therefore deſired me humbly to intreat your
Lordſhips to declare your Reſolutions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in with as much ſpeed as may
be. And in a Vote of Parliament, it's ſaid,</hi> The Houſe is well
ſatisfied of the diligence, faithfulneſs, and integrity of Sir <hi>Charles

<hi>Jeſuits</hi> and <hi>Prieſts</hi> did not appear ſo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly as in

brought to light; The Royal Favourite,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The <hi>first War</hi> begun with the clamour of <hi>Popery:</hi>
That it was admitted not onely at the <hi>Court,</hi> but into the
<hi>Church;</hi> particularly <pb n="80" facs="tcp:101057:49"/>that the King was a great
<hi>favourer</hi> of <hi>Papiſts;</hi> and the Houſe of Commons inſtance

remonſtrates, <hi>That it was more neceſſary to put the Laws in execution
at that time, than in any before: That at that time divers Petitions from
ſeveral parts of the Kingdom, complained of the great increaſe of Popery
and Superſtition; and the people call earneſtly to have the Laws put in
execution.</hi> (When theſe <hi>Petitions</hi> were promoted by their <hi>own
Members;</hi> and that <hi>Decency</hi> which was uſed in the
<hi>Church,</hi> the <hi>Superſtition</hi> and <hi>Popery</hi> which they
remonſtrated againſt: but not one word of putting the Laws in execution
againſt the <hi>Separatiſts.</hi>) 2. <hi>That Prieſts and Jeſuits
ſwarmed in great numbers: That of late years about the City of</hi> London,
<hi>Prieſts and Jeſuits have been diſcharged out of priſon: That the
Pope had then a Nuntio in the City: The great reſort to Maſs at</hi>
Demark-houſe: <hi>That on the reprieve of</hi> Goodman, <hi>the City of</hi>
London <hi>refuſed the advance of Money for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of his Majeſties
Army, for that reaſon. Therefore they deſire that</hi> Goodman <hi>may be
left to Juſtice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this the King anſwered: <hi>Concerning</hi> Goodman, <hi>that
he being found guilty onely as being a Priest, on which account neither
King</hi> 
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:101057:49"/>James <hi>nor Queen</hi> Elizabeth <hi>put any to
death, be did reprieve him; deſiring them to conſider the inconvenience
that may fall on his Subjects and other Proteſtants abroad, by executing of
ſuch ſeverity. That he will put the Laws in execution against Popery and
Superſtition, the increaſe whereof was much against his mind: That he would
ſpeedily iſſue out a Proclamation for all Prieſts and Jeſuits to
depart the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom within one month, or to be proceeded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt according
to Law. As for</hi> Roſetti <hi>the Popes</hi> Nuntio, <hi>that he had no
commiſſion, but was onely to correſpond between the Queen and the Pope;
which was warranted by Articles of Marriage: yet he had perſwaded her to
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs him within a time, to take away the offence. That he would
reſtrain the reſort of Papiſts to</hi> Denmark-houſe, <hi>and the

            </p>

neceſſitate the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan Proteſtants to keep the King as Priſoner, or
elſe to put him to death. If they keep him as a Priſoner, his diligence and
friends, and their own diviſions, will either work his deliverance, and give
him the day again by our help, or at leaſt will keep the State in a perpetual
unſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledneſs, and will bring an odium on them: or if they cut him off,
which we will rather pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, leſt they ſhould make uſe of his

King killing to fall on them, which they are wont to caſt upon us, and ſo
ſhall be able to disburthen our ſelves.</hi> Secondly, <hi>And we ſhall
have them all to pieces in Diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: for they will either ſet up a new
King, or the Parliament will keep the power, chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Government into a
Democracy. The firſt cannot be done without great Concuſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and new
Wars; and we ſhall have an opportunity to have a hand in all: and if it be
done, it may be much to our advantage. The ſecond will apparently, by
Factions and Diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, give us footing for continual attempts. But to
make all ſure, we will have our footing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Puritans too, that we may

being propounded and debated, it was concluded by the Pope, <hi>That it was

I <pb n="87" facs="tcp:101057:52"/>have done with you for ever:</hi> and God hath given her
grace to make her words good hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto. Many <hi>intelligent Travellers</hi>
can tell of the <hi>great joy</hi> among the <hi>Engliſh Convents</hi> and
<hi>Seminaries</hi> about the Kings death, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving overcome their Enemy, and
done their main work for their ſettlement in <hi>England:</hi> of which they
made themſelves ſo ſure, that the <hi>Benedictines</hi> were in great
care, that the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> ſhould not get their Land: and the
<hi>Engliſh Nuns</hi> were contending who ſhould be <hi>Abbaſſes</hi>
in <hi>England.</hi> An underſtanding Gentleman viſiting the Fryars in
<hi>Dunkirk,</hi> put them on the diſcourſe of the King's death; and to
pump out their ſence about it, ſaid, <hi>That the Jeſuits had laboured
very much to compaſs that work.</hi> To which they anſwered, <hi>That the
Jeſuits would ingroſs to themſelves the glory of all great and good
works, and of this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others; whereas they had laboured as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently and
effectually for it as they.</hi> So that both the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and
<hi>Seculars</hi> had laboured to bring the King to death: and the Army of
<hi>Fanaticks</hi> were their <hi>Inſtruments</hi> to put it in
execution.</p>
            <p>Monſieur <hi>de Bourdeaux</hi> the French Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour,
being reſident in <hi>London</hi> when General <hi>Monk</hi> had gotten the
power of the <hi>City,</hi> and the affections of the <hi>People,</hi>
earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſired to intereſt the King of <hi>France</hi> and 
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:101057:53"/>Cardinal <hi>Mazarine</hi> in the <hi>Revolution of
Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;</hi> and made way for an <hi>Addreſs</hi> to the
<hi>General,</hi> by his Brother-in-law <hi>Clergis;</hi> to whom he imparted,
that Cardinal <hi>Mazarine</hi> would be glad to have the honour of his
<hi>friendſhip,</hi> and aſſiſt him faithfully in all his Enterprizes:
and that the <hi>General</hi> might be more confident of the <hi>Cardinal,</hi>
he aſſured him that <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi> kept <hi>ſo ſtrict a
League</hi> with him, that he did not aſſume the Government without <hi>his
privity,</hi> and was directed <hi>ſtep by ſtep</hi> by him in the
progreſs of that action: and therefore if he reſolved on <hi>that
courſe,</hi> he ſhould not onely have the <hi>Cardinals friendſhip</hi>
and <hi>counſel</hi> in the attempt, but a <hi>ſafe Retreat</hi> and
<hi>honourable Support</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> if he ſailed in it. But Mr.
<hi>Clergis</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured him, that the <hi>General</hi> did not intend to
take the <hi>Government upon him,</hi> but to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit all to the
<hi>determination</hi> of the next <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King being in the Territories of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi>
when the <hi>General</hi> was minded to <hi>declare for him,</hi> Sir <hi>Jo.
Greenvil</hi> was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched by the <hi>General</hi> to his Majeſty, to
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire him to depart out of the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Dominions, to
<hi>Breda,</hi> or ſome other place under the Government of <hi>the States of
the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces;</hi> for that he had <hi>certain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence</hi> he
would be detained by the King <pb n="89" facs="tcp:101057:53"/>of <hi>Spain</hi>'s
Miniſters, if he ſtayed in his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions. Upon which <hi>Advice,</hi>
within two or three days he went to <hi>Breda,</hi> where he continued till he
was invited to his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.</p>
            <p>There was found in the Study of <hi>Francis Young,</hi> after his
death, a <hi>Paper</hi> containing <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices</hi> given to him by Seignior
<hi>Bellarini</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the beſt way of managing the <hi>Popiſh
intereſt</hi> in <hi>England</hi> upon the Kings <hi>Reſtaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
The firſt Advice is, to make the <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction</hi> of
<hi>Settlement</hi> their great deſigne, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially upon the
<hi>fundamental Conſtitutions</hi> of the Kingdom; whereunto if things
ſhould fall, they would be <hi>more firm than ever.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, To remove
the <hi>Jealouſies</hi> raiſed by <hi>Prynne, Baxter,</hi> &amp;c. of their
deſigne upon the late <hi>Factions,</hi> and to ſet up the
<hi>proſperous</hi> way of fears and jealouſies of the <hi>King</hi> and
<hi>Biſhops.</hi> Thirdly, To make it appear <hi>under-hand,</hi> how neer
the <hi>Doctrine, Worſhip,</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline</hi> of the Church of
<hi>England</hi> comes to <hi>us;</hi> at how little diſtance their
<hi>Common-prayer</hi> is from our <hi>Maſs;</hi> and that the wiſeſt and
ableſt men of <hi>that Way,</hi> are ſo moderate, that they would willingly
<hi>come over</hi> to us, or at leaſt <hi>meet us half way:</hi> hereby the
moſt <hi>ſtayed men</hi> will become more <hi>odious,</hi> and others will
<hi>run out of all Religion,</hi> for fear of <hi>Popery.</hi> Fourthly, That
there be an <hi>Indulgence</hi> promoted by <pb n="90" facs="tcp:101057:54"/>the
<hi>Factious,</hi> and ſeconded by <hi>You.</hi> Fifthly, That the
<hi>Trade</hi> and <hi>Treaſure</hi> of the Nation may be engroſſed
between <hi>themſelves</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>diſcontented Parties.</hi>
Sixthly, That the <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the Church of
<hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> be aſperſed, as either <hi>worldly</hi> and
<hi>careleſs</hi> on one hand; or <hi>ſo factious;</hi> that it were well
they were removed. All theſe <hi>Directions</hi> will appear to have been
followed preciſely by <hi>both Parties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Grandees</hi> of the <hi>Committee at Derby-houſe,</hi>
and the <hi>Army,</hi> ſollicite the detaining of the <hi>Prince</hi> in
<hi>France,</hi> and <hi>delaying</hi> his Journy for <hi>England,</hi> leſt
he ſhould trouble the <hi>yet-unſetled Kingdom</hi> of the <hi>Saints.</hi>
To negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate which, they have an Agent lying Lieger with Cardinal
<hi>Mazarine,</hi> who is ſo well ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with <hi>Money,</hi> and ſo
<hi>open-handed,</hi> that it hath been heard from <hi>Mazarine</hi>'s own
mouth, that all the Money the <hi>Queen</hi> and <hi>Prince</hi> had coſt the
Crown of <hi>France,</hi> came out of the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments</hi> Purſe, with a
good advantage. It is likewiſe ſaid, <hi>Mazarine</hi> had an Agent here,
to drive on the intereſt of <hi>France</hi> in <hi>England, Hiſt. of
Independ.</hi> 2 part, p. 112. And it is known that <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s
intereſt with <hi>France,</hi> when the <hi>preſent King</hi> fled thither,
after <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter-fight,</hi> was ſo great, that he prevailed to have
the King <hi>driven thence,</hi> to ſeek his ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in <hi>other
Countries.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="91" facs="tcp:101057:54"/>
            <p>And it is credibly reported, that <hi>Cromwel</hi> maintained or
encouraged a company of <hi>Benedictine Monks</hi> to betray the <hi>Kings
Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels:</hi> That <hi>Manning,</hi> who was executed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yong the Seas for
diſcloſing the <hi>Kings Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,</hi> was a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> and had
<hi>Maſſes</hi> ſung for him after his death: That <hi>Lambert,</hi> who
had been ſuſpected as a <hi>Papiſt</hi> thirty years, with the help of a
<hi>Popiſh Prieſt,</hi> contrived <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels new Government.</hi> And
the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, that if the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> and
<hi>Engliſh Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians</hi> ſhould cleerly and entirely graſp the
<hi>power of the Nation,</hi> it would be a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult task to take it out of
their hands; they <hi>abetted</hi> the <hi>Independent</hi> party, and other
growing <hi>Sects;</hi> they mixed themſelves with their <hi>Counſels</hi>
and <hi>Armies;</hi> as Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> affirmed. And a good Author ſays,
that a <hi>Proteſtant Gentleman</hi> met with about thirty of them at one
time, between <hi>Roan</hi> and <hi>Diep;</hi> who enquiring their deſign,
and they taking him for one of their party, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by them, that they
were going into <hi>England,</hi> and would take Arms in the <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant
Army,</hi> and endeavour to be <hi>Agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors:</hi> and what work <hi>thoſe
creatures</hi> made, is too well known!</p>
            <p>Nor is it leſs notorious, who they were that pleaded ſo
ſtrenuouſly for <hi>Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</hi> Such Tracts as directly
urged the <pb n="92" facs="tcp:101057:55"/>Toleration of <hi>Popery,</hi> as well as of
<hi>other Sects,</hi> were penned and diſperſed by the <hi>Jeſuits:</hi>
and the <hi>Indulgence</hi> granted to them by <hi>Cromwel,</hi> who was never
known to puniſh any of them for their <hi>Recuſancy,</hi> as long as they
ſerved <hi>his intereſt,</hi> argues his <hi>connivance,</hi> if not his
<hi>approbation</hi> of them. By <hi>theſe</hi> was that Treatiſe of Father

<hi>Pamphlets</hi> written to juſtifie the Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Army, were
<hi>dictated</hi> or <hi>written</hi> by the <hi>Jeſuits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the year 1652. <hi>William Birchly</hi> publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed a
Treatiſe, called <hi>The Moderator: or, Perſecution for Religion
condemned.</hi> In a <hi>Poſtſcript</hi> to which, he ſays, that <hi>he
ſubſcribed his name according to an Order of Parliament;</hi> yet is not
aſhamed to ſay, that <hi>he had his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments from ſome of the Romiſh
Prieſts;</hi> for a Toleration of whom he pleads as paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, as if
a whole <hi>Conſult</hi> of them had penned the <hi>Pamphlet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And a good Author ſaith, he hath been credibly informed, that a
<hi>Jeſuit</hi> of St. <hi>Omers</hi> declared, that <hi>they were Twenty
years in hammering out the Sect of the Quakers.</hi> And whoever conſiders
the Tenets of <hi>that Sect,</hi> 
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:101057:55"/>will eaſily ſee
<hi>whoſe</hi> off-ſpring they are. They <hi>refuſe all Oaths;</hi> which

            </p>
            <p>I have told you what <hi>White</hi> the <hi>Jeſuit</hi> did, and
that wretched <hi>Milton, Cromwel</hi>'s Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, who had been at

frequenter of the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Club,</hi> though he were <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s

            <p>
               <hi>How far the King was inclined to a reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation with the
Church of</hi> Rome (ſaith Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>) <hi>I onely deſire you to

the</hi> Grotian <hi>Deſign had great advantage in</hi> England, <hi>which he
himſelf boaſted of,</hi> p. 106.</p>
            <p>Of this <hi>indignity</hi> to that <hi>Religious Prince,</hi> the
learned Biſhop <hi>Bramhal,</hi> p. 617. of his <hi>Works,</hi> took notice,

<hi>p.</hi> 100. of his <hi>Defence,</hi> that <hi>he printed the contrary in
times of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation, and that the Informer could not prove it, and that

(I ſuppoſe) dedicated to <hi>Richard Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi> whom he did not call

prudently, and faithfully, to his immortal honour, exerciſed the

Epiſcopal party</hi> for following <hi>Grotius,</hi> he ſays: <hi>As for
the King himſelf, that was their Head, if any conjecture that he was a flat
Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt, I believe him not: but he was the head of the</hi> Grotian
<hi>Papiſts, and he himſelf boaſted of it,</hi> (ubi ſupra.) Now if any
would know how far <hi>Grotius,</hi> and conſequently the King was a
Papiſt, he ſays, <hi>He (i. e. Grotius) was a more arrant Papiſt
than</hi> Caſſander, (who dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>that Communion,</hi> and was one

give ſo many (though frivolous) <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances</hi> by way of
<hi>proof,</hi> that others might <hi>believe</hi> what Mr. <hi>B.</hi> did
not. Did not Mr. <hi>B.</hi> know, that the fear of <hi>introducing Popery</hi>
was made a chief ground of the <hi>War</hi> againſt the <hi>King?</hi> And
may he not as well make it a ground of another <hi>War</hi> againſt the

Mr. <hi>B.</hi> calls <hi>Popiſh Clergie-men?</hi> And he ſays, that
<hi>the Parliament, whom they were bound to believe, made it their great
argument and advantage againſt the King, that he favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Papiſts: and
on this ſuppoſition</hi> (ſaith <pb n="97" facs="tcp:101057:57"/>he) <hi>thouſands

their <hi>greateſt adverſaries:</hi> which, as it appears by the
<hi>diſcovery</hi> of the <hi>Plot</hi> of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> to take
away his life, mentioned in the relation of <hi>Andreas ab Habernfield,</hi>
and printed by Mr. <hi>Prynne;</hi> wherein, becauſe of his

deliver her from both:</hi> for he tells the <pb n="99" facs="tcp:101057:58"/>King, that
<hi>no one thing did make conſcientious men to waver more in their minds, and
to be drawn from the ſincerity of Religion profeſſed in the Church
of</hi> England, <hi>than the want of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form and decent Order; the Romaniſt
being apt to ſay, the Houſes of God could not be ſuffered to lye ſo
naſtily, were the true Worſhip of God obſerved in them; the external
worſhip of God in his Church, being the great witneſs to the world that our
hearts ſtand right in that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. And to deal clearly with your Majeſty,
theſe thoughts, and no other, made me labour ſo much for decency, and an
orderly ſettlement of the external Worſhip of God.</hi> To this I add, that
the Archbiſhop did no other than what was practiſed with <hi>good

            </p>
            <p>This moſt Reverend Archbiſhop was not more averſe from the

<hi>Laud</hi> (then of <hi>London</hi>) of the dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous condition of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> by the <hi>growth of Popery;</hi> and informed the Earl of

governing there by a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation <hi>de propaganda fide,</hi> eſtabliſhed
not long before at <hi>Rome:</hi> That the <hi>Popes Clergie</hi> there, was
double in number to the <hi>Kings;</hi> and they were bound by <hi>Oath</hi> to
maintain the <hi>Popes power</hi> and <hi>greatneſs</hi> againſt all
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: That the <hi>Pope</hi> had erected a <hi>Colledge</hi> in

of the <hi>new Frieries</hi> in <hi>Dublin,</hi> they erected others in the
<hi>Country,</hi> where the people flocked in <hi>great multitudes</hi> to hear
<hi>Maſs,</hi> forgetting the Principles of Religion: That a <hi>Synodical
meeting</hi> of their Clergy had been held in <hi>Drogheda,</hi> in which they
decreed, <hi>That it was not lawful to take the Oath of Allegiance;</hi> and
therefore it was thought neceſſary to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain them by a ſtanding
Army. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Lord Deputy was adviſed to ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon a
<hi>Parliament;</hi> and ſo ordered his affairs, <pb n="101" facs="tcp:101057:59"/>as to
raiſe an Army of Twenty thouſand men, which was <hi>maintained
moſtly</hi> out of the <hi>Eſtates</hi> of the <hi>Papiſts;</hi> by which
means he kept the <hi>Iriſh</hi> in awe; and had he been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued there,
that <hi>Helliſh Maſſacre</hi> on the <hi>Engliſh Proteſtants,</hi>
which followed on the withdrawing of that <hi>Great man,</hi> might in all
probability have been prevented.</p>
            <p>But theſe two <hi>Great men,</hi> the one of which made it his
buſineſs to <hi>prevent Rebellion</hi> in the <hi>State,</hi> the other to
<hi>ſuppreſs Faction</hi> and <hi>Confuſion</hi> in the Church, were made
the chief <hi>marks</hi> at which all the <hi>Plots</hi> and <hi>Darts,</hi>
both of <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> were aimed; that by their
<hi>fall,</hi> they might more eaſily deſtroy the <hi>King,</hi> as it
afterward hapned: and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their <hi>ſerious</hi> and
<hi>ſuccesful endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours</hi> to ſuppreſs <hi>Popery</hi> in
<hi>Ireland,</hi> they are reputed and accuſed for <hi>Papiſts</hi> in
<hi>England;</hi> but the true reaſon was, the <hi>Earl of Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
and the <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> being two of the moſt <hi>faithful
Miniſters</hi> of State that the King had, the <hi>Scots</hi> endeavour in
the firſt place to take them out of the way. For,</p>
            <p>A <hi>Parliament</hi> being called on <hi>Novemb.</hi> 3. 1640.
the <hi>Scots,</hi> under pretence of <hi>Religion,</hi> got a conſiderable
<hi>Party</hi> in <hi>both Houſes,</hi> to help on their <hi>deſigne.</hi>
To which end, at their entrance into <hi>England,</hi> they made a
<hi>Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance, That their just deſires ſo neceſſary for 
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:101057:60"/>the good of both Kingdoms, could find no acceſs to the
ears of their gracious King, by reaſon of the powerful diverſion of the
Archbiſhop of</hi> Canterbury, <hi>and the Deputy of</hi> Ireland; <hi>who
being ſtrengthened with a mighty Faction of Papiſts near the King, did rule
in all matters both Temporal and Eccleſiaſtical, making the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of their ſervice to his Majeſty to appear, in being the onely fit
Inſtruments, under a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of vindicating his Majeſties Honour, is
oppreſs the Liberties of his free Subjects, and the true reformed
Religion.</hi> And this <hi>Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance</hi> they ſeconded with
<hi>another Libel,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>The Intention of the Army:</hi>
ſignifying to the People of <hi>England, That they had no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne to
waſte their Goods, or ſpoil their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, but onely to petition his
Majeſty to call a Parliament, and to bring the Archbiſhop and Deputy to
condign puniſhment.</hi> At this time they ſet forth a Book againſt the
Archbiſhop, called <hi>Laudenſium Autocatacriſis,</hi> endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to
prove out of the Archbiſhop's Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, that he deſigned to bring in
<hi>Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Popery,</hi> and <hi>Arminianiſm.</hi> There comes
alſo a <hi>Petition</hi> from ſome <hi>Lords,</hi> complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the
<hi>great increaſe of Popery,</hi> and of <hi>many inconveniencies drawn on
the Kingdom by engaging againſt the Scots.</hi> This was ſigned by the
Earls of <hi>Eſſex, Hartford, Rutland, Bedford, Exeter, Warwick,
Mulgrave,</hi> and <pb n="103" facs="tcp:101057:60"/>
               <hi>Bullingbrooke;</hi> the Lords
<hi>Say, Mandevil, Brook,</hi> and <hi>Howard.</hi> And this was
<hi>ſeconded</hi> by another from <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The day for the ſitting of the <hi>Parliament</hi> being
appointed on the third of <hi>November,</hi> the <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> was
adviſed that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the 20 of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. which
<hi>began</hi> in the <hi>fall</hi> of Cardinal <hi>Wolſey</hi> and the
<hi>diminution</hi> of the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>priviledges</hi> of the
<hi>Clergie,</hi> and <hi>ended</hi> in the <hi>diſſolution</hi> of
<hi>Religious houſes,</hi> was begun on the ſame day; and therefore he
ſhould move the King to reſpite their ſitting for a day or two. The
<hi>event</hi> proved too ſadly ominous: for <hi>this</hi> begun with the
<hi>fall</hi> of the <hi>Archbiſhop,</hi> the <hi>Rites</hi> and
<hi>Priviledges</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh Clergie, Biſhops, Deans and
Chapters;</hi> and the <hi>Cathedrals</hi> left without any means to
<hi>repair</hi> them.</p>
            <p>But there were other <hi>ſtrange accidents</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by
Dr. <hi>Heylen,</hi> in the <hi>Life</hi> of the <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,</hi> p. 450.
On <hi>Friday</hi>-night, <hi>Jan.</hi> 24. 1639. he dreamt <hi>that his Father
came to him,</hi> and askt him what he did there: <hi>and he asked his Father
how long he would ſtay there: who replied, He would ſtay till he had him
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with him.</hi> This Dream he noted in his <hi>Breviate.</hi> In
<hi>December</hi> that year, the <hi>Boats</hi> that were drawn on
<hi>land</hi> neer <hi>Lambeth,</hi> were by a violent tempeſt <hi>daſht
againſt one another</hi> and <hi>broken in pieces.</hi> And the tops of
<hi>two <pb n="104" facs="tcp:101057:61"/>Chimneys</hi> were blown down, and beat through
the Lead and Rafters on the Bed in which he was wont to lie; but the
roughneſs of the water kept him that night at his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in
<hi>White-hall.</hi> The ſame night, at <hi>Croy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> one of the
<hi>Pinacles</hi> fell from the <hi>Steeple,</hi> and beat down the Lead and
Roof of the Church twenty foot ſquare. The ſame night, at the
<hi>Metropolitical Church</hi> in <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> one of the
<hi>Pinacles</hi> which carried a Vane with the <hi>Archbiſhop's Arms</hi>
upon it, was blown down, and carried a good diſtance off; falling on the Roof
of a <hi>Cloyſter,</hi> where the <hi>Arms</hi> of the <hi>See of
Canterbury</hi> were ingraven in Stone, which by the fall of the
<hi>Pinacle</hi> were broken in pieces: whereat ſome did
<hi>conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,</hi> that he ſhould not onely fall himſelf, but the
<hi>Archiepiſcopal Dignity</hi> ſhould fall with him. But the Archbiſhop
took moſt notice of anotheer Accident on St. <hi>Simon</hi> and
<hi>Jude's</hi> Eve, a week before the ſitting of the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>
when going into his <hi>upper Study</hi> where his <hi>Picture</hi> in full
length was wont to hang, he found it <hi>fallen on the ground,</hi> and lying
flat on its face.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Saturday,</hi> May 9. 1640. a <hi>Paper</hi> was poſted
on the <hi>Exchange,</hi> animating the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices to ſack his Houſe at
<hi>Lambeth:</hi> the <hi>Munday</hi> following, he therefore ſo
<hi>fortified</hi> his <hi>Palace,</hi> that though five hundred perſons
at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted <pb n="105" facs="tcp:101057:61"/>it, they could do nothing: but they
<hi>broke</hi> open the <hi>Priſons</hi> in <hi>Southwark,</hi> and
<hi>freed</hi> their <hi>Comrades;</hi> for which actions one
<hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteed</hi> a Leader of the Rabble was condemned and executed.</p>
            <p>The great cry was, That <hi>he endeavoured to bring in
Popery.</hi> Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> ſays, he was <hi>at leaſt a
Caſſandrian Papiſt,</hi> and <hi>endeavoured a reconciliation between us
and</hi> Rome. A Book written againſt him, called <hi>The Engliſh
Pope,</hi> printed 1643. tells us <hi>how far the King and Pope had agreed. The
King</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a Diſpenſation from the Pope that the
En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Catholicks might reſort to the Proteſtant Churches, &amp; take
the Oaths of Allegiance and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy; and that the Popes Supremacy was to be
changed into a Priority; and that marriage ſhould be permitted to the
Prieſts, the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion adminiſtred under both kinds, and the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie in
the Engliſh Tongue.</hi> But though theſe <hi>Conceſſions</hi> were
more than the <hi>Pope</hi> would grant, yet <hi>another Libel</hi> ſays,
<hi>There were general Propoſitions made for this agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and that the
Archbiſhop had made ſome Innovations in order thereto,</hi> Popes Nuncio,
<hi>p.</hi> 11. But what the <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> did, was not with a
reſpect to peace with <hi>Rome,</hi> but to the ſetling of the Church of
<hi>England</hi> on the <hi>firſt Principles</hi> of <hi>Reformation,</hi>
and to make it more <hi>amiable</hi> even to the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> whom he 
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:101057:62"/>aimed to <hi>win over</hi> firſt by
<hi>Conferences,</hi> and then by an <hi>external Decency</hi> in the
<hi>publick Service;</hi> the <hi>Catholicks</hi> being much offended at the
<hi>ſlovenly keeping</hi> of our <hi>Churches,</hi> and the
<hi>irreverence</hi> of the People at their <hi>Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> And though
ſome accounted the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop's actions in <hi>renewing ancient Rites</hi>
to give <hi>advantage</hi> to <hi>Popery,</hi> yet others more knowing ſaid,
that it would tend to the <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> and <hi>advantage</hi> of the
<hi>Church of England:</hi> for Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> reports, that he heard from
a perſon of <hi>known Nobility,</hi> that being with a <hi>Father</hi> of the
<hi>Engliſh Colledge</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> one of the <hi>Novices</hi> told
him with <hi>great joy,</hi> that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were about to ſet up
<hi>Altars,</hi> and offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate in <hi>Copes,</hi> to <hi>adorn</hi> their
<hi>Churches,</hi> and <hi>paint</hi> their <hi>Windows;</hi> and were
<hi>returning to the Church of Rome.</hi> To whom the <hi>Father</hi> replied
with ſome <hi>indignation,</hi> That <hi>he talked like an ignorant Novice,
and that theſe proceedings ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tended to the ruine than advancement of
the Catholick Cauſe, becauſe the Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>coming nearer
to the ancient <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſages, the Catholicks there would be ſooner drawn off
from them, than any of that Nation would fall off to</hi> Rome.</p>
            <p>Some things are objected againſt him in relation to the
<hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Devotion</hi> of the <hi>Church:</hi> as, That the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was held to be a <hi>true Church:</hi> That <hi>the
Pope hath <pb n="107" facs="tcp:101057:62"/>a primacy over other Biſhops:</hi> That <hi>it
apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to him to call General Councils:</hi> That <hi>Altars might be
erected:</hi> That <hi>he was not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Pope ſhould be called
Antichriſt;</hi> or that <hi>every raw Preacher ſhould trouble his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
with Popiſh Controverſies.</hi> Some of which were <hi>falſe
Inſinuations,</hi> and others <hi>vain</hi> and <hi>frivolous.</hi> In the
<hi>Liturgies</hi> of <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th, and <hi>Edward</hi> the 6th, was
this Expreſſion: <hi>From the Tyranny of the Biſhop of Rome, and all his
deteſtable Enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Good Lord,</hi> &amp;c. Which words were
<hi>expunged</hi> in the firſt of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> leſt they
ſhould affright the <hi>Catholicks</hi> from co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to our Churches: on
which ground the Archbiſhop finding in a Book of Prayer for the fifth of
<hi>November</hi> (not confirmed by Law) theſe paſſages: <hi>Root out the
Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh and Antichriſtian Sect, which ſay of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, Down with
it,</hi> &amp;c. And again, <hi>Cut off thoſe workers of iniquity, whoſe
Religion is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, and whoſe Faith is Faction:</hi> He made theſe
ſmall <hi>alterations.</hi> In the firſt, thus: <hi>Root out the
Babyloniſh and Antichriſtian Sect [of them] which ſay,</hi> &amp;c. In
the ſecond, thus: <hi>Cut off thoſe workers of iniquity who turn Religion
into Rebellion,</hi> &amp;c. Againſt which, <hi>ſome</hi> being conſcious
it was intended againſt them, made <hi>Objections.</hi> Which the
Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop did, onely to avoid the giving of cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs 
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:101057:63"/>offences to the <hi>Romiſh Party.</hi> Which doubtleſs
he endeavoured with all his skill to <hi>ſuppreſs.</hi> And beſides his
<hi>learned Diſputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> againſt them, he procured a <hi>Canon</hi>
to be paſs'd in the <hi>Convocation, For ſuppreſſing the further growth
of Popery, and reducing Papiſts to Church:</hi> and iſſued very
<hi>ſtrict</hi> and <hi>effectual Orders</hi> for the execution thereof. But
it was the <hi>method,</hi> whether of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> or
<hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> or <hi>both,</hi> to defame them moſt for Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, who
acted moſt <hi>ſucceſsfully</hi> againſt them; as did this
<hi>Biſhop,</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Bramhall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A <hi>paſſage</hi> or two in the Archbiſhop's
<hi>Speech</hi> at his death, may ſatisfie all ſober Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. <hi>I pray
God</hi> (ſays he) <hi>the clamours of</hi> venient Romani <hi>(of which I
have given no cauſe) help not to bring them in. Concerning the King. I
ſhall be bold to ſay, He hath been much traduced for bringing in of Popery:
but on my Conſcience (of which I ſhall give God a very preſent account) I
know him to be as free from this charge as any man living: and I hold him to be
as ſound a Proteſtant (according to the Religion by Law eſtabliſhed) as
any man in this Kingdom; and that he will venture his life as far and as freely
for it: And I think I do or ſhould know both his affection to Religion, and
his grounds for it, as fully as any man in</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. <hi>For my ſelf, I
was born and baptized in the Church of</hi> England, <hi>and the Religion by 
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:101057:63"/>Law eſtabliſhed: in that I have ever ſince li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and in that I come now to die. This is no time to diſſemble with God,
leaſt of all in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion; and therefore I deſire it may be
remembred, I have always lived in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion eſtabliſhed
in</hi> England, <hi>and in that I come now to die. What clamours and
ſlanders I have endured for labouring a <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity in the external Service
of God, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Doctrine and Diſcipline of the Church, all men
know, and I have abundantly felt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have obſerved the <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Jeſuits</hi>
and <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> wherein they <hi>agree,</hi> and have <hi>joyntly</hi>
acted againſt the Government in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> for the
ruine of both; and how, like <hi>Janus</hi> his head, they did not onely look
<hi>backward,</hi> to the <hi>Juſtification</hi> of the <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> of
the <hi>old King,</hi> but <hi>forward,</hi> to <hi>prevent</hi> the
<hi>Reſtauration</hi> of <hi>his preſent Majeſty.</hi> And hitherto their
Practices have been according. It remains now that we conſider, what
<hi>theſe Factions</hi> have <hi>practiſed</hi> to <hi>hinder</hi> that
<hi>happy Reſtauration,</hi> by Gods <hi>miraculous providence,</hi> and the

from coming to his <hi>Fathers Throne,</hi> hath been partly diſcovered

               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:101057:64"/>did. And will begin with the <hi>Scots,</hi> who called him home
firſt, to <hi>vex</hi> and <hi>tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> him with their <hi>unrighteous
dealings,</hi> and <hi>temptations</hi> between <hi>hopes</hi> and
<hi>fears,</hi> and <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted him</hi> with unſufferable Reproaches
<hi>for the ſins of his Father and Grandfather, as well as his own:</hi>
inſomuch that he often attempted to <hi>leave them,</hi> fearing, as it came
to paſs, that they would at laſt <hi>betray him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What <hi>provocations</hi> he met with in private, may be

miſchief in Religion all the days of his life,</hi> p. 73. And <hi>p.</hi>
52. he tells our <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign</hi> to his face, <hi>That a King abuſing his
power to the overthrow of Religion, Laws, and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which are the
Fundamentals of that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, may be controuled and oppoſed: and if he
ſet himſelf to overthrow all theſe by Arms, they who have the power, as
the Eſtates of the <pb n="111" facs="tcp:101057:64"/>Land, may and ought to reſiſt by
Arms; becauſe he doth by that oppoſition break the very Bonds, and
overthrow the Eſſentials of this Contract and Covenant. This may
ſerve</hi> (ſays he) <hi>to juſtifie the proceedings of this Kingdom
against the late King, who in a hoſtile way ſet himſelf to overthrow
Religion, Parliaments, Laws, and Liberties.</hi> Thus was the <hi>Scotiſh
Crown</hi> lined with <hi>Thorns;</hi> and the King had <hi>Gall and Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
given him to drink,</hi> inſtead of the <hi>Royal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;</hi> of which
he ſays, <hi>p.</hi> 34. <hi>The Biſhops be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved to perform this Right,
and the King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved to be ſworn to them: but now, by the bleſſing of
God, Popery and Prelacy are removed, let the anointing of Kings with Oyl go to
the door with them, and let them never come in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</hi> So that although
the <hi>Scots Army</hi> were overthrown at <hi>Worceſter,</hi> yet his
Majeſty e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaping with ſafety and liberty (by a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Providence) he
was (as the event now ſhews) a very <hi>great Gainer</hi> by that
<hi>Loſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as to his Majeſties <hi>return</hi> into <hi>England,</hi>
it is very evident that they had not forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten their <hi>old Doctrine</hi> of
<hi>binding their Kings in Chains;</hi> and therefore they endeavoured to lay
ſuch <hi>Conditions</hi> and <hi>Fetters</hi> on the <hi>King,</hi> as
neither his <hi>Father could,</hi> nor <hi>He would</hi> be able to bear. As
ſoon as ever the <hi>General</hi>'s intent to bring home the King was 
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:101057:65"/>known, there were frequent and zealous Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications made,
That the <hi>godly Miniſters</hi> of the Land might be <hi>provided for,</hi>
and the <hi>King</hi> might be a <hi>Covenanting King.</hi> And he was dehorted
from <hi>calling him home,</hi> by one Mr. <hi>Baxter, Becauſe</hi> (as he
ſaid) <hi>Profaneneſs was ſo inſeparable from the Royal Party, that if
e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the King returned, the power of Godlineſs would be loſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>ſame perſon</hi> being admitted to preach before that
<hi>remainder</hi> of the <hi>Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> when they were
conſulting to <hi>call home</hi> the <hi>King,</hi> he delivered not one word
that might <hi>promote</hi> that <hi>Noble Deſigne,</hi> but many things that
might <hi>hinder,</hi> or <hi>clog</hi> it with very diſhonourable terms. He
intimates the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Power</hi> to be <hi>ſtill</hi> in the <hi>two
Houſes,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his <hi>Holy Commonwealth</hi>'s Maximes. He
ſays indeed, <hi>That</hi> Rom. 13. <hi>is part of the Rule of his
Religion;</hi> but adds, <hi>There hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily been a difference amongst us
which is the Higher Power: but he was fully of the mind as he had formerly
declared, That it was in the two Houſes:</hi> and therefore he adds, <hi>It
was not the intent of St.</hi> Peter <hi>or St.</hi> Paul <hi>to determine
whether the Emperour or the Senate were Supreme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the ſame <hi>Humiliation-Sermon,</hi> he mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies the
<hi>Loyalty</hi> of the <hi>Presbyterians;</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jures the <hi>Commons</hi>
to <hi>oppoſe Epiſcopacy</hi> (though <pb n="113" facs="tcp:101057:65"/>the
<hi>King</hi> in his <hi>Meſſage</hi> commended it to be <hi>as
ancient</hi> as the <hi>Monarchy</hi> in this Iſland) and under the titles of
<hi>ſound Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Church-Government,</hi> pleads for
<hi>Presbytery;</hi> and that the <hi>Church-Revenues</hi> might be
<hi>ſetled on them.</hi> p. 46. ſaying, <hi>Give firſt to God the things
that are Gods.</hi> For them he pleads, as being the <hi>godly, peaceable,</hi>
and <hi>prudent people</hi> of the Land, in oppoſition to
<hi>Profaneſs.</hi> And to inſinuate <hi>new fears</hi> and
<hi>jealouſies,</hi> cries out, <hi>O what happy times did we once
ſee!</hi> He did not mean the <hi>peaceable time</hi> of <hi>King Charles the
Firſt;</hi> thoſe were, in his account, <hi>days of Profaneſs and
Perſecution:</hi> He muſt mean either <hi>under the Long Parliament,</hi>
or ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the <hi>Revolutions of Government,</hi> when he was a
<hi>Souldier,</hi> or enjoyed a <hi>Sequeſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and
<hi>Plunder,</hi> &amp;c. And yet <hi>this man</hi> boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth that the King
was <hi>voted home</hi> the next day after <hi>that Sermon</hi> of his; as if
<hi>that had not been done,</hi> if he had not <hi>preached:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he
ſeems to me to be of the <hi>ſame mind</hi> that he was of <hi>a year
before,</hi> when he decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>p.</hi> 486. of <hi>Holy Com. That having
often ſearched into his heart whether he did lawfully engage in the</hi>
(firſt) <hi>War or not, and encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged ſo many thouſands, he could not
ſee that he was miſtaken in the main Cauſe; nor dares he repent of it,
nor forbear doing the ſame, if it were to do again, in the ſame ſtate of
things.</hi>

            <pb n="114" facs="tcp:101057:66"/>
            <p>There is one <hi>myſterious tranſaction</hi> of the
<hi>Fanatick Party,</hi> whereby they endeavoured to <hi>impoſe upon the
King</hi> before his <hi>return:</hi> they had (it ſeems) drawn up ſome
<hi>Heads</hi> in favour of <hi>Presbytery,</hi> and to the prejudice of the
<hi>Epiſcopal Government;</hi> which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired the <hi>King</hi> to

the <hi>exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> of the <hi>times,</hi> and the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of
<hi>his own affairs,</hi> did publiſh in a <hi>Declaration</hi> from

<hi>That he would leave the particulars therein mentioned to be conſidered

<hi>conformed,</hi> on this Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the <hi>Species of
Prelacy</hi> was <hi>altered</hi> by it. And Mr. <hi>B.</hi> foreſeeing that
the <hi>Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Party</hi> would be <hi>grieved</hi> by it, makes this
<hi>Objection</hi> (againſt thoſe that <hi>extorted</hi> that

            </p>
            <p>Object. <hi>You did but obtrude on us your own Opinions: for when

for the preſent to grant them to you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this Mr. <hi>B.</hi> anſwers: <hi>If we did offer ſuch
things</hi> (which is a <hi>confeſſion</hi>) <hi>let the world judge what

            <p>So that it is evident, that they did what they could to bring the
<hi>King</hi> under their <hi>Chains,</hi> before he came to his
<hi>Crown;</hi> and had not a <hi>ſuperiour power,</hi> by the conduct of the

<hi>unpeaceable men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And whereas his Majeſty deſired them to read ſo much of the

heard not of any <hi>compliance</hi> to that <hi>juſt deſire,</hi> though
<hi>they confeſſed they could uſe the greateſt part of it.</hi> But
inſtead thereof, they clamour for a <hi>Reformation of Doctrie, Diſcipline,

of <hi>both Parties</hi> might be employed to compile ſuch a <hi>new
Form</hi> as they there deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed; or at leaſt to <hi>reviſe</hi> and

<hi>Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> of <hi>Octob.</hi> 5. expreſſed his <hi>eſteem</hi>
of the <hi>Old;</hi> but <hi>grants</hi> the ſecond, and iſſues out his

of the <hi>Forms</hi> wherewith the people were acquainted.</p>
            <p>But inſtead of this, they draw up <hi>another Liturgie,</hi> or

ſays) in eight days; and againſt the conſent of the greateſt part,
offers <hi>that,</hi> in oppoſition to the <hi>eſtabliſhed

ſpeaks: <hi>Take heed how you drive men by penalties on that which they judge
doth tend to their damnation.</hi> And <hi>p</hi> 14. <hi>The denial of their
deſires would renew all our troubles.</hi> And they alſo deſire the
<hi>King</hi> to leave out of his <hi>Declaration</hi> theſe words: <hi>We do
not in our judgments believe the practice of thoſe particular Ceremonies we
except againſt to be in it ſelf unlawful,</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> we do
account them ſinful.) And in the cloſe of the ſecond <hi>Paper,</hi> they
tell the <hi>King,</hi> if he grant thoſe favours, <hi>It would revive their
hearts to pray for his proſperity: but</hi> (p. 12.) <hi>ſhould we loſe
the opportunity of our deſired Reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it aſtoniſheth us to

            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> made a <hi>Prognoſtication,</hi> dated 
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:101057:67"/>1661. <hi>When by the Kings Commiſſion</hi> (ſays
he) <hi>we in vain treated for Concord, to tell the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops what they are,
and what they muſt expect: That they are worldly, proud, covetous,
domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neering, malignant, and lazy; the plague of the world, troublers of
Princes, and dividers of Churches,</hi> p. 32. &amp; p. 9. 12, 13. and animates
the people to <hi>revile,</hi> p. 14. 20. 22. and, which is <hi>notorious,</hi>
p. 28. n. 105. <hi>That where</hi> PA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PISTS OR HERETICKS <hi>are ſhut out by
Law, they will ſecretly contribute the utmoſt of their endeavours to make
the ſufferings of diſſenting Proteſtants as grievous as poſſibly
they can; that in deſpite of them, their own neceſſities may compel them
to cry out for Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, till they procured a common Toleration for all, and
opened the door for Papiſts and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, as well as for themſelves.</hi>
And he hath lived to make good his Prognoſtick, like <hi>Noſtredamus</hi>
his Son, who having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied that on ſuch a day <hi>the City ſhould be
burnt,</hi> he <hi>ſet it on fire himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Toleration,</hi> by which <hi>Papiſts</hi> were
indulged as well as <hi>other Diſſenters,</hi> it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that it was
obtained by the <hi>mutual en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours</hi> of <hi>both Parties. Coleman</hi>
confeſſeth it in behalf of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
the <hi>ruine</hi> of our <hi>Church,</hi> to which they thought it <hi>a

               <hi>peaceable Deſigne,</hi> p.
71. ſpeaks, <hi>in the name of his Brethren,</hi> to this effect: <hi>What
ſhall we ſay then to the Papiſt?</hi> Anſw. <hi>The Papiſt in our
account is but one ſort of Recuſants, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious and
peaceable among them muſt be held in the ſame predicament with thoſe
among our ſelves, that likewiſe refuſe to come to Common-Prayer.</hi>
And, <hi>p.</hi> 72. <hi>As for the common Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt who lives innocently in
his way, he is to us as other Separatiſts, and ſo comes under the like
Toleration. And I</hi> (ſaith Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>) <hi>ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle fear the
noiſe of the cenſorious, that even now while the Plot doth render them
moſt odious, ſay freely,</hi> 1. <hi>That I would have Papiſts uſed
like men.</hi> 2. <hi>I would have no man put to death for being a
Prieſt.</hi> 3. <hi>I would have no Writ</hi> de Excommunicato capiendo,
<hi>or any Law compel them to our Communion and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> p. 19. of
<hi>ſecond Defence.</hi> And <hi>p.</hi> 235. of his <hi>firſt Plea,</hi>
he ſays, <hi>It is but reaſonable, if on ſuch neceſſity</hi> (<hi>i.
e.</hi> the Penalties for Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformity) <hi>they ſhould accept of favour
from any Papiſt that ſhould ſave them,</hi> &amp;c. So that they are
reſolved to live in <hi>compliance</hi> with the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> rather
than in <hi>conformity</hi> with the <hi>eſtabliſhed Church.</hi> And here
it appears, whether the <hi>Conformiſt</hi> or <hi>Nonconformist</hi> is the
greater Friend to <hi>Popery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>'s <hi>Defence,</hi> penned by an

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:101057:68"/>
               <hi>a Secret which I have heard, but hope he will not put
me to prove it: That the Parliament made good Laws; the Papiſt out of a
pretended reverence to tender Conſciences, hindred the execution of them; and
ſome leading Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks had a private encouragement (to ſay no more) to
ſet up a mighty cry of Perſecution, to caſt all the odium on a
perſecuting Church, and Dioceſan Canoneers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> takes this hint. <hi>Some have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported</hi>
(ſays he) <hi>that ſome of the Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts do or have received money
from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts to act their affairs, and promote their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts;</hi>
which he calls a <hi>putrid Calumny,</hi> &amp;c. and avows, <hi>That never any
perſon in Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Dignity, or Power in the Nation, or that had any
relation to pullick affairs, nor any from them, Papist or Proteſtant, did
once ſpeak one word to him, or adviſe with him about any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence or
Toleration to be granted to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts.</hi> He ſays not, <hi>That he
never received a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Moneys or Meſſage to promote a general
To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration;</hi> which, he thinking himſelf particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly <hi>reflected</hi>
on, might have done in few words. And my Author deſires Dr. <hi>O.</hi> to
reſolve him why a <hi>Fast</hi> was appointed by a certain <hi>Independent
Paſtor</hi> at that time, on the fifth of <hi>November,</hi> which (as he
notes) is <hi>no Popiſh Feſtival.</hi> Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> (one of their
Confederates) ſays, <hi>It is well known ſeveral <pb n="120" facs="tcp:101057:69"/>of
them</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi>) <hi>were in Penſion
to the D. And no men have been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter received of the D. than</hi> J. J. J. O.

the Bulwark of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>If one Party,</hi> ſaith Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> (viz. <hi>the
Authority of the Nation</hi>) <hi>would bring them to ſuch a paſs, that
they must be hanged, impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ruined, or worſe, (as if they were in the
hands of Canibals) unleſs the favour of the Papiſts deliver them; and the
other Party</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi>) <hi>had rather
be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Papiſts, than be hanged or ruined by Proteſtants; they
ought not to be ſuſpected of Popery.</hi> This is not onely to open a door
to <hi>let the Papiſts in,</hi> but upon meer <hi>Fears</hi> and
<hi>Jealouſies</hi> to <hi>flee out to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now judge who is a <hi>greater friend to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery;</hi> the <hi>old
Proteſtants,</hi> who have made <hi>Law</hi> to <hi>keep it out;</hi> or the
<hi>Diſſenters,</hi> who would deſtroy thoſe <hi>Laws</hi> to <hi>let
it in.</hi> And that their <hi>obſtinate ſeparation</hi> from the
<hi>Church-Communion</hi> is an effectual means thereunto, I ſhall give the
judgment of Mr. <hi>Phil. Nye,</hi> a great <hi>Covenanter,</hi> who, not long
before his death, foreſeeing the <hi>miſchievous conſequence</hi> of
thoſe <hi>extravagant heats</hi> the people were running into, wrote a
<hi>Diſcourſe</hi> on purpoſe to <pb n="121" facs="tcp:101057:69" rendition="simple:additions"/>prove it
lawful to <hi>hear the conforming Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters;</hi> and anſwers all the
<hi>common Objections</hi> againſt it; and <hi>wonders</hi> how the
<hi>different Parties</hi> came to be <hi>ſo agreed,</hi> in thinking it
<hi>unlawful</hi> to hear us preach. But he ſaith he is perſwaded, it is
<hi>one conſtant deſigne</hi> of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> in the <hi>variety of
ways of Religion</hi> he hath ſet on foot by <hi>Jeſuits</hi> among us:
<hi>Let us therefore be more aware of whatſoever tends that way.</hi> So that
Mr. <hi>Nye</hi> plainly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth that the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> were
<hi>very buſie</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong <hi>them;</hi> and that <hi>they</hi> and the
<hi>Devil</hi> joyned together in ſetting them at the <hi>grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
diſtance</hi> poſſible from the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and that
thoſe who would <hi>countermine</hi> the <hi>Devil</hi> and the
<hi>Jeſuits,</hi> muſt avoid what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever tends to that <hi>height of
Separation.</hi>

            <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſeemed to be of the ſame judgment,
<hi>p.</hi> 17. of his Preface to the <hi>Defence</hi> of <hi>the Cure of
Church-diviſions,</hi> where he ſaith, <hi>Our Diviſions gratifie the
Papiſts, and greatly hazard the Proteſtant Religion more than most of you
ſeem to believe or regard.</hi> And had Mr. <hi>B. regarded</hi> as he ought,
he would not have <hi>hardened</hi> the People in that <hi>Separation,</hi> as
he hath ſince done. For he ſays again, <hi>That among the many
inconveniencies of Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, this is one, that Popery will get by it ſo
great advantage, as may hazard us all; and we may loſe that which the
ſeveral Parties do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend <pb n="122" facs="tcp:101057:70"/>about.</hi> Yet, as you have
heard, <hi>theſe men</hi> joyned intereſt with the <hi>Papiſts</hi> to
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure this <hi>miſchievous Toleration. Coleman</hi> at his <hi>Tryal</hi>
owned that he was of opinion, <hi>That Popery might come in, if liberty of
Conſcience had been granted.</hi> And the Author of the <hi>two Conferences
between</hi> Le Cheſe <hi>and the four Jeſuits,</hi> owns that the
<hi>Declaration of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence</hi> was procured by help of the
<hi>Papiſts,</hi> who were included in it; but ſaith, <hi>The
Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians preſently ſuſpected the kindneſs, and like wiſe men
cloſed with the Conformiſts;</hi> when on the contrary, they wrote <hi>in
defence</hi> of it, and ſo increaſed the <hi>Schiſm,</hi> that we feel
the <hi>effects</hi> of it to this day. And I my ſelf have obſerved, how
much a <hi>Popiſh Lord</hi> of theſe <hi>Weſtern parts,</hi> was
careſſed by the <hi>Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> in <hi>theſe parts,</hi> upon
the <hi>Indulgence;</hi> and how <hi>kind</hi> he was to them.</p>

               </gap>t in Mr. <hi>B's Prognoſtick,</hi> p. 200. ſpeaking to the
<hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Clergie,</hi> he ſays, <hi>It may be your great
Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons may die, or FALL, or forſake you; and then your hearts are broken:
it may be death may enter into your Families, and make you think what
bloud-thirſtineſs doth tend to.</hi> Now what manner of <hi>Fall</hi> and
<hi>Death</hi> he means, he explains, <hi>p.</hi> 204. <hi>One</hi> Felton
<hi>may end the great Duke of</hi> Buckingham, <hi>p.</hi> 205. <hi>Or they may
meet with ſuch Executioners as Cardinal</hi> 
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:101057:70"/>Beton. Nor
was Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> a <hi>falſe Prophet,</hi> though perhaps a <hi>bloudy
one</hi> in this <hi>Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick;</hi> witneſs that <hi>horrid
Aſſaſſination</hi> of the <hi>Archbiſhop of St. Andrews,</hi> one of
his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Privy Counſellors, <hi>May</hi> 3. 1679; who coming from
<hi>Edinburg</hi> in his Coach with one Daughter, was aſſaulted by twelve
men well armed. The Coachman perceiving it, drove as faſt as ſix good
horſes could run. But they purſued, ſhooting into the Coach. And one
<hi>Balfour</hi> rid up to the Poſtilion, woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him with a Sword on his
face, ſhot one of the forehorſes, hamſtring'd another, and ſo ſtopt
the Coach; and the reſt of the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers being come up, one of them fired a
Piſtol ſo near his breaſt, that his Daughter rubbed off the burning from
his Gown. Then calling him <hi>Dog, Villain, Apoſtate, and Perſecutor of
the Godly, Decrier of Jeſus Chriſt and his Church, bid him come out of his
Coach to receive what he deſerved for his wickedneſs against the Kirk
of</hi> Scotland. Upon which his Daughter got out of the Coach, and fell on her
knees, begging her Fathers life: but they regarding not her Prayers or Tears,
threw her on the ground, trampling on her, and wounding her: which her
tender-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Father ſeeing, after many threatnings came meekly out of the
Coach, and calmly ſaid to them, <hi>I know not that I ever injured 
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:101057:71"/>any of you; or if I did, I am ready to make you
reparation; and therefore I beſeech you to ſpare my life, and I promiſe I
will never purſue you for this violence. And I pray you conſider, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you bring the guilt of innocent bloud upon your ſelves.</hi> This made them
ſtand a while, and one of them relenting, cried, <hi>Spare theſe gray
hairs;</hi> but the reſt replied, <hi>He muſt die, he muſt die:</hi> and
then repeating their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful words, ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt now receive
the reward of thy Apoſtacy, and Enmity to the people of God.</hi> At which
the <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged a little time to pray, telling them he would
pray for them: but they ſcornfully told him, <hi>They cared not for his
Prayers, being ſure that God would not hear ſo baſe a Dog as he was.</hi>
Then looking ſtedfaſtly on one of the Aſſaſſines whom he ſeemed
to know, he kneeled before him, ſaying, <hi>Sir, you are a Gentleman, and I
muſt beg my laſt favour from you: Since you are reſolved that I must die,
have pity on my poor Child, and ſpare her life; and for this, Sir, give me
your hand.</hi> And ſtretching out his hand, he had for a return a very great
blow with a Shable, which almoſt cut off his hand. And the Villain
redoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his ſtroak, gave him another violent wound on the leſt eye,
which cut him two inches above it, and one below it. This ſtroak knocked him
down: but getting on <pb n="125" facs="tcp:101057:71"/>his knees again, he ſaid,
<hi>Gentlemen, it is now enough, you have done your work:</hi> and holding up
his hands to Heaven as well as he could, he fervently cried out, <hi>Lord
Jeſus, have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on my Soul, and receive my Spirit.</hi> While he was in
this poſture of Devotion, they wounded him in his hands which he held up to
Heaven, and in other parts of his body, till in a kind of compoſure he laid
down his head on his arm, ſaying, <hi>God forgive you, and I forgive you
all.</hi> Theſe were his laſt words: after which, they gave him about
ſixteen wounds in his head, ſo that it ſeemed to be but one wound; and
pieces of his Skull and Brains were found on the ground. And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving left him,
ſome fancied that they heard him groan; which made them go back, and to make
ſure work, ſtirred his Brains with the points of their Swords. Then they
made his Servants ſwear not to diſcover them; and bad them in deriſion
take up their Prieſt; and rode back to <hi>Magus.</hi> And one of them,
<hi>John Balfour</hi> of <hi>Kinlock,</hi> paſſing by that Town, was heard
to ſay, that <hi>Now Judas was killed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe things were <hi>teſtified</hi> before the
<hi>Privy-Council</hi> by the Oaths of his <hi>Daughter</hi> and
<hi>Servants;</hi> and the <hi>Wounds</hi> given him were particularly
mentioned in a <hi>Certificate</hi> of a <hi>Doctor of Phyſick</hi> and
<hi>three Chirurgeons,</hi> 
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:101057:72"/>who by <hi>Order of the
Council</hi> did <hi>view</hi> and <hi>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balm</hi> his body. The
Aſſaſſines were <hi>notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Fanaticks,</hi> Frequenters of
<hi>Field-Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> and Followers of Mr. <hi>Welſh</hi> and other
<hi>trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous</hi> and <hi>rebellious Preachers.</hi> Nine of the Actors were
diſcovered by their <hi>names.</hi> The <hi>Depoſitions</hi> of the
<hi>Witneſſes</hi> againſt them lie on <hi>record,</hi> to ſatisfie all
men particularly. One <hi>James Anderſon,</hi> Farmour, ſays, that
<hi>George Balfour</hi> came to his Brothers houſe after the Murther, at
<hi>Gilſton,</hi> and told him <hi>it was done;</hi> and that <hi>the reſt
of the Murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> waited for him on <hi>Tace's Moore;</hi> and that he
returning to them, they poſſeſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of a Barn at
<hi>Toukits</hi> about three in the afternoon, and parted thence about ſeven;
when all of them ſpake with the ſaid <hi>Ander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> who knew them
all particularly, and thus named them; <hi>John Balfour</hi> of <hi>Kinlock,
David Hacſton</hi> of <hi>Rathillet, George Balfour</hi> of <hi>Gilſton,
James Ruſſel</hi> of <hi>Kingſcattle, Robert Dingwall</hi> a Farmer's Son
in <hi>Cadham, Andrew Guillan</hi> a Weaver in <hi>Balmerinock, Alexander
Henderſon,</hi> and <hi>Andrew Henderſon</hi> Son of Sir <hi>John
Henderſon</hi> in <hi>Kilbrackmont, George Flem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming</hi> Son to <hi>George
Flemming</hi> in <hi>Balbathy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This diſcovery being made, the <hi>late Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion</hi> on the
29th of <hi>May</hi> broke out; which forced the <hi>Privy-Council</hi> to
deſiſt from the purſuit of the <hi>Murtherers,</hi> that they might 
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:101057:72"/>ſuppreſs <hi>that Inſurrection;</hi> which would
have <hi>ſhaken the Government,</hi> if the Rebels had got the firſt
<hi>Victory,</hi> or <hi>kept their ground.</hi> In which Army the
<hi>Murtherers</hi> ſheltred them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the <hi>Conventiclers,</hi>
who called themſelves <hi>the Covenanting Army:</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beaten, the
<hi>Murtherers</hi> fled the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: but while the Army lay at
<hi>Glaſcow,</hi> one of the <hi>Balfours</hi> openly boaſted of the
<hi>Murther</hi> as a <hi>glorious fact;</hi> and ſaid, holding up his Arm,
<hi>This hand helped to kill the Fox.</hi> And five of their Confederates
choſe to <hi>die</hi> and <hi>hang in Chains</hi> on the place, rather than
to confeſs the <hi>ſinfulneſs</hi> of the Action, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it to
be a <hi>Murther</hi> or a <hi>Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One <hi>Mitchel,</hi> who attempted the Murder of <hi>this
Archbiſhop</hi> eleven years before, was <hi>applauded</hi> for it by ſome
<hi>Covenanters.</hi> My Author quotes the <hi>Principles</hi> on which theſe
Murtherers acted. <hi>Goodman,</hi> p. 27. of <hi>Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Tyranny,</hi>
ſays, <hi>That all men are bound to ſee the Laws of God kept, and to
ſuppreſs and reſiſt Idolatry by force: nor is it ſufficient for
Subjects not to obey the wicked commands of Princes, but they muſt reſiſt
them, and deliver the children of God out of the hands of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, as we
would deliver a Sheep in danger to be devoured by a Wolf: and if the
Magiſtrate ſhall refuſe to put Maſs-mongers and falſe Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers to
death, the people in ſeeing it performed <pb n="128" facs="tcp:101057:73"/>ſhew that
zeal of God which was commended in</hi> Phinees.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gilby</hi> ſays, <hi>That Kings, Princes, and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
have their Authority from the People, and on occaſion the People may take it
away again, as men may revoke their Proxies. It is lawful</hi> (ſaith he)
<hi>to kill wicked Kings and Tyrants. The Subjects did kill the Queens
Highneſs</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaliah; John <hi>killed the Queens Majeſty</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabel;
Elias, <hi>being no Magiſtrate, killed the Queens Majeſties Chaplains,</hi>
Baal<hi>'s Prieſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Knox</hi> in his Debate with <hi>Lithinton,</hi> (<hi>Hiſt.
of Reformat.</hi> p. 390.) juſtifies the killing of <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical
Princes,</hi> and men in <hi>publick places,</hi> by <hi>private
perſons,</hi> from the Example of <hi>Phinees, who,</hi> he ſays, <hi>was a
private perſon,</hi> whoſe fact was <hi>approved</hi> and
<hi>rewarded;</hi> and affirms that it ought to be <hi>imitated</hi> by thoſe
who prefer the <hi>true Worſhip</hi> and <hi>Glory of God,</hi> to the
<hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> of <hi>fleſhly</hi> and <hi>wicked Princes:</hi> and
ſays, that <hi>this Example approved by God, ſtands inſtead of a Command:
for as God is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable, ſo he cannot condemn that which he hath approved in
his Servants before us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Book called <hi>Naphtali,</hi> juſtifieth the
<hi>Rebellion</hi> at <hi>Pentland-Hills,</hi> Anno 1666, from <hi>the ſame
Example,</hi> aſcribing it to the <hi>Holy Spirit of God;</hi> aſſerting,
that <hi>the Rebels were no more Traytors, than</hi> Phinees <hi>was a
Murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; being led by the ſame Spirit, and had as <pb n="129" facs="tcp:101057:73"/>good
warrant,</hi> p. 21, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The ſame Doctrine as defended by a Book
called <hi>Jus populi vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatum,</hi> ch. 20. p. 409, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> On
this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple Mr. <hi>Mitchel</hi> attempted to murther the Archbiſhop,
<hi>Anno</hi> 1668. and did mortally wound the Biſhop of <hi>Orkney;</hi> for
which he was executed: (See <hi>Ravilliack Redivivus:</hi>) but died
impenitently, believing he was <hi>led to this heroical act by the Spirit of
God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe and ſuch Books, are uſed by the
<hi>Field-Conventiclers</hi> more than the <hi>Practice of Piety.</hi> One of
them being taken and ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, had <hi>Naphtali</hi> in one Pocket, and a
<hi>Piſtol charged with two Bullets</hi> in the other; <hi>i. e.</hi> (as a
Gentleman ſaid) The <hi>Doctrine</hi> for <hi>one hand,</hi> and the
<hi>Application</hi> for the <hi>other.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>other Pamphlets,</hi>
ſuch as was the <hi>Apologie,</hi> and <hi>Apologetical Narration, The poor
mans Cup, The Hiſtory of the Indulgence,</hi> were printed in
<hi>Scotland;</hi> and many to the <hi>like purpoſe</hi> in <hi>England,</hi>
under the Titles of <hi>Pleas for Peace,</hi> the <hi>Celeuſma,</hi> &amp;c.
defaming the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> as <hi>Apoſtate perjured Prelates, Traytors
to Chriſt, Enemies to his People, Thorns and Thiſtles, bloudy
Perſecutors, Popiſh Clergie-men,</hi> &amp;c. to prepare the people to
<hi>another Rebellion,</hi> and <hi>Aſſaſſinations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It would be too large to repeat the <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, Wars,</hi> and
<hi>malicious Murthers</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in <hi>Scotland</hi> by the
<hi>Conventiclers</hi> upon <pb n="130" facs="tcp:101057:74"/>ſuch as according to the
Laws ſought to <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs</hi> them; and how they <hi>juſtified</hi>
them all in ſeveral <hi>Pamphlets,</hi> which are in the hand of almoſt all
that can read them. How <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately</hi> they <hi>died,</hi>
juſtifying themſelves in thoſe <hi>horrid Actions:</hi> chuſing rather
to <hi>die,</hi> than confeſs the <hi>ſinfulneſs</hi> of them, and to
<hi>beg pardon,</hi> or to <hi>pray for the King,</hi> and <hi>promiſe
o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. Mitchel</hi> at his death ſaid, That <hi>he laid down his life
willingly, in oppoſition to the perfidious Prelates, and in teſtimony of
the Cauſe of Chriſt;</hi> and in his <hi>Speech,</hi> ſaith,
<hi>Bleſſed are all they that take the proud Prelates and daſh their
brains againſt the ſtones.</hi> And yet we have had ſome <hi>at
home,</hi> who have not onely <hi>pitied</hi> theſe men, but <hi>promoted
their Practices</hi> there, and frequently attempted the ſame in
<hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since his Majeſties <hi>return,</hi> who can but wonder at the
<hi>Enthuſiaſtick madneſs</hi> of <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> and the
<hi>Fifth-monarchy-men,</hi> who with leſs than half an hundred of men,
attempted the whole City of <hi>London!</hi> And the <hi>Plot</hi> in
<hi>December</hi> 1662, to cut off <hi>Root</hi> and <hi>Branch, King. Queen,
Duke, Biſhops,</hi> and <hi>Gentry,</hi> that none of them might <hi>run
beyond Sea;</hi> for which <hi>Tong, Philips, Stubbs, Hinde, Sallers,</hi> and
<hi>Gibbs,</hi> were executed at <hi>Tyburn:</hi> which <hi>Plot</hi> was to be
carried on upon the <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>jealouſie</hi> of a <hi>Popiſh
Maſſacre.</hi> And ſeditious <pb n="131" facs="tcp:101057:74"/>
               <hi>Letters</hi> were
diſperſed to that purpoſe; a copy of which was read in the Court: and the
<hi>Fifth-monarchy-men, Quakers, Anabaptiſts,</hi> and all ſorts of
<hi>Fanaticks</hi> were invited to joyn in the <hi>Plot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next year, <hi>March</hi> 21. 1663. <hi>another Plot</hi> was
diſcovered in the <hi>North,</hi> of which the King ſays in his Speech,
That <hi>it was of a large extent, and very near execution, had he not by Gods
goodneſs come to the knowledge of the principal Contrivers, and ſecured
them from executing their intended miſchief.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the year 1666. there was <hi>another Plot</hi> to <hi>murther
his Majeſty,</hi> and <hi>overthrow the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;</hi> to <hi>kill the
General, ſurprize the Tower, fire the City;</hi> and a <hi>Junto</hi>
ſetled in <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Money</hi> provided to carry on this
deſigne: for which <hi>Rathbone, Sanders, Tuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, Flint, Evans, Miles,
Weſtcot,</hi> and <hi>Coles,</hi> were executed.</p>
            <p>And whether ſuch <hi>bloudy practices</hi> as theſe have not
been <hi>encouraged</hi> by thoſe <hi>Principles</hi> which the
<hi>Jeſuits</hi> and <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> eſpecially Mr. <hi>White</hi> and
Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> have <hi>publiſhed</hi> in print, is ſo evident, that
it can admit of no diſpute or contradiction; eſpecially if it be

            <p>Mr. <hi>Vernon</hi> in his <hi>Life of Dr.</hi> Heylin
<hi>(Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face ad finem:)</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> (ſays he) <hi>may be

<hi>in</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop; <hi>where the Kings Party being worſted, the Major was
ſtript almoſt naked, and left for dead in the Field: but Mr.</hi> Baxter
<hi>and one Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> Hurdman <hi>walking among the wounded and dead
bodies, perceived ſome life left in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor; and</hi> Hurdman <hi>run him
through the body in cold bloud, Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>all the while looking on,
and taking off with his own hand the Kings Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture from about his neck;
telling him, as he was ſwimming in his Gore, that he was a Popiſh Rogue,
and that was his Crucifix: which Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture was kept by Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>for
many years, till it was got from him, but not without much difficulty, by one
Mr.</hi> Summerfield, <hi>who then lived with Sir</hi> Tho. Rous, <hi>and

<hi>Loyalty</hi> and <hi>love to the Church,</hi> the King had ſuch
<hi>ſignal proofs,</hi> that he kept them between fourteen and fifteen years

found all things in <hi>confuſion,</hi> and met with <hi>great
dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties</hi> and <hi>oppoſition;</hi> the <hi>Revenues of the

<hi>Him</hi> from that <hi>precarious</hi> and <hi>neceſſitous</hi>
condition which was the occaſion of his <hi>Royal Fathers ruine:</hi> the

well eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed for <hi>holineſs</hi> and <hi>beauty</hi> too, as that
it was once more the <hi>envy</hi> of the <hi>Factions.</hi> The Laws made for

that there needed nothing but a <hi>due execution</hi> of them, to
<hi>deſtroy the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.</hi> And as to <hi>Popery,</hi> the <hi>old
Laws</hi> were not only <hi>revived,</hi> but a <hi>new Teſt</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived,
to <hi>diſcover</hi> and <hi>diſable</hi> thoſe of that Perſwaſion
from <hi>doing miſchief.</hi> There was a Bill prepared by the <hi>Houſe of
Lords</hi> for <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the Proteſtant Religion as it was then
eſtabliſhed,</hi> eſpecially againſt <hi>Popery;</hi> which was ſo
contrived by a <hi>ſelect Committee</hi> of the moſt <hi>Religious and

            </p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> who had been of <hi>all
parties,</hi> but never true to the intereſt of <pb n="136" facs="tcp:101057:77"/>
               <hi>any,</hi> had <hi>ſerew'd</hi> himſelf into the quality of a

<hi>abroad;</hi> which the <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>Royal Brother</hi> not
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting, he became an <hi>enemy</hi> to both, and made it his buſineſs
to <hi>perplex</hi> and <hi>embroil</hi> the affairs of the Three Nations. And
the better to effect it, made himſelf the <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Fanatick
Party;</hi> who thinking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>oppreſſed</hi> for want of
liberty to <hi>ruine themſelves</hi> and <hi>others,</hi> and finding no
hopes of <hi>ſuch</hi> a <hi>liberty</hi> from that <hi>Parliament,</hi>
uſed all poſſible <hi>arts</hi> to bring it into <hi>contempt,</hi> in
order to its <hi>diſſolution;</hi> being confident, that if that
<hi>could</hi> be effected, they ſhould be able to make ſuch a
<hi>choice</hi> of <hi>Parliament-men</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>another
Seſſion,</hi> as would <hi>eſpouſe their intereſt.</hi> And indeed
they were <hi>not deceived:</hi> for in the <hi>ſucceeding Parliaments,</hi>
they had retrieved the <hi>Good old Cauſe,</hi> if the great prudence of His
<hi>Majeſty,</hi> and the <hi>Religious Loyalty</hi> of the <hi>Houſe of
Peers,</hi> had not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented it.</p>
            <p>And herein they might be aſſured of the <hi>mutual
aſſiſtance</hi> of the <hi>Popiſh party,</hi> who had conceived as
great a <hi>prejudice</hi> againſt this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, as the other; and
whoſe <hi>hopes</hi> were grounded on our <hi>Diviſions</hi> which
<hi>they</hi> alſo, in conjunction with the <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> thought 
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:101057:77"/>would moſt probably be effected, by the <hi>new
Election</hi> of <hi>Parliament-men. Coleman</hi> is made <hi>chief Agent</hi>
of the <hi>Popiſh party;</hi> upon whom though <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> looked
aſquint, yet they <hi>both</hi> acted the <hi>ſame thing, (viz.)</hi> the
<hi>diſſolution</hi> of the Parliament. Some ſaid they were a company of
<hi>young raw States-men,</hi> that gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted whatever the King deſired,
without any <hi>deliberation.</hi> To this the King anſwered, that <hi>if
they were young and beardleſs now, he would keep them till their beards were
grown, and they had got more experience.</hi> Then comes forth in print a
<hi>Narrator,</hi> which tells the people, that <hi>the Houſe of Commons are
a company of indigent and out-lawed perſons, The Court-Favourites, or the
Dukes Creatures, and Penſioners to the King of</hi> France; and <hi>as
ſuch,</hi> the Names of the moſt <hi>Loyal Members</hi> were poſted up in
the <hi>City,</hi> and publiſhed in the <hi>Country,</hi> to render them
odious, and <hi>uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> of <hi>another Election.</hi> The Biſhops

            <p>At length, the <hi>King</hi> having, for reaſons beſt known to

ſo I am confident, there was, is, and will be a <hi>Fanatick Plot</hi>

            <p>As for the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> they thought their work was
ſufficiently carried on, by the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions</hi> which they had

<hi>Richard Langhorne</hi> was condemned the ſame day. And the Lord

            </p>
            <p>It is true, that all theſe (<hi>Coleman</hi> onely excepted,

(<hi>Whitebread</hi>'s Predeceſſor, a <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal</hi> of the Jeſuits)
being accuſed for the <hi>Gunpowder-treaſon,</hi> as holding

confeſſed, he beg'd pardon, and confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed he had <hi>offended,</hi> if
<hi>Equivocation</hi> did not help him. <hi>Treſham,</hi> another of the

proteſted <hi>a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death, that his former Confeſſion was

               <hi>The Jeſuits Catechiſm,</hi> penned, as is ſaid,

him to ſtand in a ſtiff denial of it at the time of Execution, as being

            <p>The Author of <hi>Remarks on the Debates of the Houſe at</hi>
Oxford, tells us, That <hi>thoſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates were as great a Witneſs for the
King, as any he had:</hi> For <hi>R. M.</hi> (ſays he) ſaid, <hi>That the
King's telling them in his Speech that he would ſtick to his Reſolutions as
to the Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and his propoſing an Expedient, is arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and
French; and that it was the Kings de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne to cow the Parliament, to bring
them to</hi> Oxford: <hi>And that neither Biſhops, nor Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors, nor
Miniſters of State, nor thoſe of the Goſpel, have endeavoured to
preſerve Religion or Safety. T. B.</hi> ſays plainly, <hi>They must let
bloud.</hi> Sir <hi>N. C.</hi> ſays, <hi>As I underſtand, it is propoſed
the Government ſhall be in Regency du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Duke's life: I would be
ſatisfied, if the D. will not ſubmit to that, whether thoſe that fight
againſt him are not Traytors in Law. H. B.</hi> ſays, <hi>The ſame
interest that paſſeth the Bill here, will do it in</hi> Scotland. Another
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts, <pb n="158" facs="tcp:101057:88"/>That <hi>all about the King ſhould be
remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and that, though Miniſters have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, yet the Government
hath been in ſuch hands, as that the ſame Principles remain.</hi> Sir
<hi>W. C.</hi> ſays, That <hi>the weight of</hi> England <hi>is the people;
and the more they know, the heavier they will be; and that in all Ages they
have ſunk ill Miniſters of State.</hi> (And doubtleſs <hi>good ones</hi>
too.) R. H. <hi>looks on the ſlipping the Bill for Repealing the Act of</hi>
35 <hi>of</hi> Eliz. <hi>to be a breach of the Conſtitution of the
Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which if it had been moved in Queen</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeth<hi>'s days,
that motion would certainly have been ſo thought. B. W.</hi> ſays of the
King's Speech, That <hi>it was none of his; that it had nothing of his in it;
that it is flat and ſhort; That his Majeſty was a better man, and a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Proteſtant, than to make it himſelf; and that they who adviſed it, muſt
anſwer for it.</hi> And yet to ſhew on whom he meant to throw this
<hi>Dirt,</hi> he ſays afterward, <hi>The King hath gone on in a reſolution
as far as this in his Speech, in his Declaration formerly.</hi> Sir <hi>W.
J.</hi> obſerves, That <hi>no man knowing in Laws or Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, but can tell
us, that to Bills grateful and popular, the King gives his conſent. L.
G.</hi> is <hi>diſſatisfied with theſe hands in which the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is,
and fears the Kings being Abſolute:</hi> And therefore Sir <hi>F. W.</hi>

            <p>The <hi>miſchiefs</hi> of <hi>altering the Succeſſion,</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Fanatick Party</hi> carried on their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes <hi>more

<hi>Doleman</hi> or <hi>Parſons</hi> the Jeſuit's Tract of

miſerable. If he be not excluded, he doth it certainly: and we will not
entail a War upon the Nation, though for the ſake and intereſt of the
glorious Family of the</hi> Stuarts. And to effect this, he tells the People,
That <hi>the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal and Riſe of Government is in the People; and that as

pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent, that Parliaments have been unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably <pb n="165" facs="tcp:101057:91"/>prorogued and diſſolved, when they have been in hot purſuit of

Aſſiſtants.</p>
                        <p>And that the ſaid D. in order to reduce all into his own
power, hath procured the Gariſons, the Arms and Ammunition, and all the power
of the Seas and Souldiery, and Lands belonging to theſe three Kingdoms, to be
put into the hands of his Party and their Adherents, even in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to
the Advice and Order of the laſt Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
                        <p>And as we conſidering with heavy hearts how greatly the
Strength, Reputation, and Treaſure of the Kingdom, both at Sea and Land, is
waſted and conſumed, and loſt by the intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate expenſive management of
theſe wicked de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive Deſignes; and finding the ſame Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
after exemplary Juſtice upon ſome of the Conſpirators, to be ſtill
purſued with the utmost devilliſh Malice, and deſire of Revenge; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
his Majeſty is in continual hazard of being murdered to make way for the
ſaid D.'s ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement to the Crown, and the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in ſuch caſe
is deſtitute of all ſecurity of their Religion, Laws, Eſtates, and
Liberty, ſad experience in the caſe, Queen <hi>Mary</hi> having proved the
wiſeſt Laws to be of little force to keep out Popery and Tyranny under a
Popiſh Prince.</p>
                        <p>We have therefore endeavoured in a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary 
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:101057:92"/>way, by a Bill for the purpoſe, to Bar and Exclude the
ſaid Duke from the Succeſſion to the Crown, and to baniſh him for ever
out of theſe Kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> But the
firſt means of the King and Kingdoms Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty being utterly rejected, and we
left almoſt in deſpair of obtaining any real and effectual ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and
knowing our ſelves to be intruſted to adviſe and act for the
preſervation of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and the Kingdom, and being perſwaded in our
Conſciences that the dangers aforeſaid are ſo imminent and preſſing,
that there ought to be no delay of the beſt means that are in our power to
fecure the Kingdom againſt them. We have thought fit to propoſe to all true
Proteſtants an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion amongst themſelves, by ſolemn and ſacred
promiſe of mutual Defence and Aſſiſtance in the preſervation of the
true Proteſtant Religion, his Majeſties Perſon and Royal State, and our

                        <p>FOraſmuch as theſe Kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Ireland,</hi> by the wonderful providence of Almighty God, many years
ſince have been delivered from the ſlavery and ſuperſtition of Popery,
which had deſpoiled the King of his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign power, for that it did and
doth advance the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> to a power over Soveraign Princes, and
makes him Monarch of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, and doth withdraw the Subjects from
their Allegiance, by pretended Abſolutions from all former Oaths and
Obligations to their lawful Soveraign, and by many Superſtitions and
Immoralities, hath quite ſubverted the ends of the Chriſtian Religion: but
notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that Popery hath been long ſince con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the Laws
and Statutes of this Realm, for the deteſtable Doctrine and treaſonable
at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of its Adherents againſt the Lives of their lawful Soveraigns,
Kings and Queens of theſe Realms, yet the Emiſſaries, Prieſts, and
Agents for the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> reſorting into this Kingdom in great
numbers, contrary to the Laws thereof, have for ſeveral years late paſt, as
well by their own devilliſh arts and policies, as by counſel and
aſſiſtance of foreign Princes <pb n="171" facs="tcp:101057:94"/>and Prelates, known
enemies to theſe Nations, contrived and carried on a moſt horrid and
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrable Conſpiracy to deſtroy and murder the Perſon of his moſt
ſacred Majeſty, and to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the ancient Government of theſe Realms.
and to extirpate the Proteſtant Religion, and maſſacre the true
Profeſſors thereof: And for the better effecting their wicked deſignes,
and encouraging their villanous Accomplices, they have traiterouſly ſeduced
the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> preſumptive Heir of theſe Crowns, to the
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigled him to enter
into ſeveral Negotiations with the Pope, his Cardinals, and Nuntio's, for
promoting the Romiſh Church and Interest; and by his means and procurement
have advanced the power and greatneſs of the French King, to the manifeſt
hazard of theſe Kingdoms; that by the deſcent of theſe Crowns upon a
Papiſt, and by foreign Alliances and Aſſiſtance, they may be able to
ſucceed in their wicked and villanous deſignes. And foraſmuch as the
Parliaments of <hi>England,</hi> according to the Laws and Statutes thereof,
have heretofore, for great and weighty reaſons of State, and for the publick
good and common intereſt of this Kingdom, directed and limited the
Succeſſion of the Crown in other man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner than of courſe it would
otherwiſe have gone, but never had ſuch important and urgent Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as
at this time preſs and require their uſing <pb n="172" facs="tcp:101057:95"/>their
extraordinary power in that behalf: Be it therefore enacted by the Kings moſt
excellent Majeſty, by and with the advice and conſent of the Lords
Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons in this preſent Parliament
aſſembled, and by the Authority of the ſame; and it is hereby enacted
accordingly, That <hi>James</hi> Duke of <hi>York, Albany,</hi> and
<hi>Ulſter,</hi> having departed openly from the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
and having publickly profeſſed and owned the Popiſh Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which hath
notoriouſly given birth and life to the moſt damnable and helliſh Plot,
by the moſt gracious providence of God lately brought to light, ſhall be
excluded and diſabled, and is hereby excluded and diſabled for ever, from
poſſeſſing, having, holding, inheriting, or enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Imperial
Crowns and Governments of this Realm, and theſe Kingdoms, and of all
Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories, Countries, and Dominions, now, or which ſhall hereafter be
under his Majeſties ſubjection; and off and from all Titles, Rights,
Prerogatives, and Revenues with the ſaid Crowns now or hereafter to be
enjoyed: And that upon the demiſe or death of his Majeſty without Heirs of
his body, (whom God long preſerve) the Crowns and Governments of this
Kingdom, and all Territories, Countries, and Dominions, now, or which ſhall
hereafter be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Majeſties ſubjection, with all the Rights,
Prerogatives, and Revenues therewith of right <pb n="173" facs="tcp:101057:95"/>enjoyed, and
to be enjoyed, ſhall devolve and come upon ſuch perſon who ſhall be
next lawful Heir of the ſame, and who ſhall have always been truly and
profeſſedly of the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion now eſtabliſhed by Law within
this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; as if the ſaid Duke of <hi>York</hi> were actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally dead: And
that whatever acts of ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign power the ſaid Duke of <hi>York</hi>
ſhall at any time exert or exerciſe, ſhall be taken, deemed, and
adjudged, and are hereby declared and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted High-Treaſon, and to be
puniſhed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. And foraſmuch as the peace, ſafety, and well being
of theſe Kingdoms, do ſo intirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the due execution of, and
obedience to this Law, Be it further enacted by the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity aforeſaid,
That if any perſon ſhall in any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, at any time, during the King's life
(which God long preſerve) or after his demiſe or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe, aid,
aſſiſt, counſel, or hold correſpondence with the ſaid Duke of
<hi>York,</hi> who is and ought to be eſteemed a perpetual Enemy to theſe
Kingdoms and Governments, either within theſe Kingdoms or out of them; or
ſhall endeavour or contrive his return into either of them, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any of
the Territories or Dominions of the ſame; or ſhall during the King's life
publiſh or declare him to be the lawful or rightful Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, apparent,
preſumptive, or other Heir to the Crown of <hi>England;</hi> or ſhall after
the demiſe or deceaſe of the King that now is, proclaim, publiſh, 
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:101057:96"/>or declare the ſaid Duke of <hi>York</hi> to be King, or
to have right or title to the Crown or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>England</hi> or
<hi>Ireland;</hi> or ſhall by word, writing, or printing, maintain or
aſſert that he hath any manner of right or title to the Crown or Government
of theſe Kingdoms, and ſhall be therefore convict upon the evidence of two
or more lawful and credible Witneſſes, ſhall be adjudged guilty of
High-Treaſon, and ſhall ſuffer and forfeit as in caſes of
High-Treaſon. And foraſmuch as the Duke's return and coming into any of the
foreſaid Kingdoms, Countries, Territories, or Dominions, will naturally
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to bring vaſt miſchiefs, and all the evils hereby provided
againſt upon them, in War and Slaughter, and unſpeakable Calamity, which
therefore the ſaid Duke muſt be preſumed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne by ſuch his
return or coming into any the foreſaid Kingdoms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Be it
therefore like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe enacted, and it is hereby enacted by the Authority
aforeſaid, That if the ſaid Duke do at any time hereafter return or come
into any of the foreſaid Kingdoms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he ſhall be, and hereby
is thereupon attainted of High-Treaſon: And all manner of perſons
whatſoever are autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſed and required to apprehend, ſecure, and
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon his perſon; and in caſe of reſiſtance made by him, or any

            <p>During the late ſeditious <hi>Stirs</hi> and <hi>Tumults,</hi>
none was more active than one <hi>Stephen Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> (a <hi>Joyner</hi> of

ſowing <hi>Sedition,</hi> and talking <hi>Treaſon</hi> ſo openly, that
his Friends adviſed him to forbear, leſt he came to the <hi>Gallows.</hi>
He made it his buſineſs to ſerve ſome <hi>diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Lords,</hi>
boaſting of his acquaintance with the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> Lords
<hi>Gray, Howard, Clare, Huntington, Pagit, Lovelace,</hi> &amp;c. He had

<hi>pretence</hi> for his <hi>treaſonable actions,</hi> was his zeal
againſt <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who (he ſaid) had feigned ſeventeen or
eighteen <hi>Sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plots</hi> againſt the <hi>Proteſtants:</hi> he affirmed
that <hi>London</hi> was to be <hi>ſeized</hi> by the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and
that they had a <hi>deſigne</hi> againſt the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> at

perſwaded, came well armed thither. Divers <hi>Ribbons</hi> were provided as
a <hi>mark</hi> of <hi>diſtinction,</hi> bearing this Motto: NO POPERY, NO
SLAVERY; one of which he gave to <hi>Turbervil,</hi> and it was proved, as the
<hi>Lord Chief Juſtice</hi> ſaid at the cloſe of the Tryal, whom he
called <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts:</hi> The <hi>King</hi> was a Papiſt, the

            <p>He was indicted for <hi>High-Treaſon,</hi> the 17 and 18 of
<hi>Auguſt</hi> 1681, it being proved that he ſaid, <hi>That nothing of

nothing material, and that it was but a jocoſe diſcourſe,</hi> p. 39. To
which Mr. Juſtice <hi>Jones</hi> replied, <hi>Do you make mirth of the

of the late King? Colledge</hi> anſwered, <hi>I never juſtified that

            </p>
            <p>One Mr. <hi>Jennings,</hi> who was another Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
teſtified, that on the bleeding of <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>'s Noſe, he ſaid,
<hi>It was the first bloud that he loſt in the Cauſe, but it will not be

            <p>It is obſerved in the Tryal, that there was <hi>not one
Papist</hi> that gave evidence againſt him; and that they were ſuch of whom
<hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> had formerly given <hi>a good Character;</hi> though now the
caſe was altered. The <hi>Jury</hi> were ſo well ſatisfied with the

            <p>Captain <hi>Tho. Walcot</hi> was indicted for

<hi>endeavouring to move and ſtir up War and Rebellion againſt the King, to

conſpired with divers other Traytors, and had ſeveral meetings and

he was beheaded in <hi>Lincolns-Inne-Fields,</hi> July 21. 1683.</p>
            <p>The next was the Tryal of Mr. <hi>Rous,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom Mr.

               <hi>Algernon Sidney</hi> was tryed at the Kings-Bench-Bar, on the
7th, 21th, and 27th of <hi>November</hi> 1683. His Indictment was almoſt the
ſame as the former, onely there was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to it, his ſending of <hi>Aaron
Smith</hi> into <hi>Scotland</hi> to excite and ſtir up the Subjects to a
Rebellion there; and his being the Author of a traiterous Libel, containing,
among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeditious diſcourſes, theſe words <hi>(viz.) The power
originally in the People of</hi> England <hi>is delegated unto the Parliament:
He</hi> (the moſt ſerene Lord <hi>Charles the Second</hi> now <hi>King of
England</hi> meaning) <hi>is ſubject unto the Law of God, as he is a man; to
the People that makes him a King, inaſmuch as he is a King: the Law ſets a
meaſure unto that Subjection, and the Parliament judges of particular caſes
thereupon ariſing. He muſt be content to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit his intereſt to
theirs, ſince he is no more than any one of them in any other reſpect, than
that he is by the conſent of all, raiſed above any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. If he doth not
like this condition, he may renounce the Crown: but if he receive it upon that
condition (as all Magiſtrates do the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er they receive) and ſwear to
perform it, he muſt expect that the performance will be exacted, or revenge
taken by thoſe that he hath betrayed.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="184" facs="tcp:101057:101"/>
            <p>And in other places theſe traiterous Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences are contained:
<hi>viz. We may therefore change or take away Kings without breaking any Yoke,
or that is made a Yoke which is not one: the injury is therefore in making and
impoſing, and there can be none in breaking it,</hi> &amp;c. In <hi>p.</hi>
23, 24, 25, &amp; 26. many other things were read at the Tryal, out of that
<hi>Libel;</hi> parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly <hi>p.</hi> 26. where ſpeaking of a King, he
ſays, <hi>When the matter is brought to that, that he must not reign, or the
People over whom he would reign must periſh, it is eaſily decided. As if
the Queſtion had been asked in the time of</hi> Nero <hi>or</hi> Domitian,
<hi>whether they ſhould be left at liberty to deſtroy the best part of the
world, as they endeavoured to do, or it ſhould be reſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their
deſtruction! And as for the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples being Judges in their own caſe, it is
plain they ought to be the onely Judges, becauſe it is their own, and onely
concerns themſelves.</hi> The Attorney-General (<hi>p.</hi> 13.) ſays,
<hi>The whole Book is an Argument for the People to riſe in Arms and
vindicate their Wrongs.</hi> He <hi>(i. e. Sidney)</hi> lays it down, <hi>That
the King hath no authority to diſſolve the Parliament: but 'tis apparent
the King hath diſſolved many; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath broken his Truſt, and
invaded our Rights. And concludes, We may therefore ſhake off the Yoke: for
'tis not a Yoke we ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to, but a Yoke by Tyranny</hi> (that is the
meaning of it) <hi>impoſed on us.</hi>

            <p>I ſhall adde onely a few <hi>Remarks</hi> on the dying
<hi>Speeches</hi> and <hi>Confeſſion</hi> of theſe men: and firſt of
Col. <hi>Sidney.</hi> He had no other Apology for himſelf, but that he had
been <hi>engaged from his youth in that Old Cauſe;</hi> for which he prayed,
in theſe words: <hi>Defend thine own Cauſe, and defend theſe that defend
it: ſtir up ſuch as are faint, direct thoſe that are willing, confirm
thoſe that waver; give wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and integrity unto all—Grant that I
may die glorifying thee for all thy mercies, and that at the laſt thou haſt
permitted me to be ſingled out as a Witneſs of thy Truth, and even by the
confeſſion of my Oppoſers, for that Old Cauſe in which I was from my
youth engaged, and for which thou haſt often and wonderfully declared thy
ſelf.</hi> Now the <hi>Old Cauſe</hi> wherein Col. <hi>Sidney</hi> was
engaged, was the deſtruction of the <hi>Church,</hi> and the <hi>Royal
Martyr,</hi> to ſet up a <hi>Commonwealth;</hi> in which he acted as a
<hi>Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel,</hi> 
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:101057:102"/>and one of the <hi>Judges</hi> of the
<hi>Royal Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr:</hi> yet he calls theſe Treaſons <hi>Gods Truth.</hi> In
what Religion this Gentleman died, God onely knows: for he made no
profeſſion at all, whether <hi>Presbyterian, Independent,
Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſt,</hi> or <hi>Quaker;</hi> but <hi>a Proteſtant at large,</hi>
as any of thoſe Factions term themſelves.</p>
            <p>As to the Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> he was alſo unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
engaged in the ſame <hi>OLD CA<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SE</hi> from his youth, as may appear by the
follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Relation. Mr. <hi>Johnſon,</hi> the Author of the <hi>Life of
Julian,</hi> confirmed him in his riper years in thoſe opinions which<note n="*">This <hi>Lewis</hi> was a ſtickling
<hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian,</hi> that had gotten the Seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of
<hi>Totnam-high-croſs</hi> from Mr. <hi>Wimpew</hi> a loyal Miniſter of the
Church of <hi>England.</hi> To this <hi>Lewis</hi> many Noblemen and Gentlemen
ſent their Sons for Education: among whom was the late Lord
<hi>Ruſſel.</hi> And to divert his Scholars, he compoſed a
<hi>Farce,</hi> wherein the young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were to be <hi>Actors.</hi> The
<hi>Farce</hi> had all the Formalities of a <hi>High Court of Juſtice;</hi>
Preſident, Sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, Witneſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Criminal</hi>
was an old Shock <hi>Water-Dog,</hi> which he called <hi>Charles Stuart.</hi>
This Dog was arraigned, tryed, condemned, and executed by cutting off his head.
By which action he inſtilled the Principles of <hi>Ring-killing</hi> into his
Scholars; as if the murdering of a <hi>King,</hi> were no more than the
<hi>cutting off a Dogs neck.</hi>
               </note> Mr. <hi>Lewis</hi> and Dr.
<hi>Manton</hi> had educated him. For Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> having written
that <hi>Traiterous Book,</hi> to defend the miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Doctrine of
<hi>Reſiſtance,</hi> this unhappy man could not be extricated from that
ſnare, to his death. And it was long before his acquaintance with 
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:101057:102"/>this <hi>Seditious Author,</hi> that Dr. <hi>Manton,</hi>
a great <hi>Abettor</hi> of <hi>the firſt War,</hi> and a <hi>Favourite</hi>
of <hi>Cromwel,</hi> had inſtilled the ſame Principles into him. For in his
<hi>Comment on St. James</hi> 4.1. he propoſeth this Queſtion: <hi>Whether
Religion may be defended by Arms?</hi> To which he anſwers; <hi>That
ſometime the outward exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Religion and Worſhip may be
eſtabliſhed and ſecured by Laws; and among other Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges and Rights,
the liberty of pure Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip may be one; which being invaded by Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
may be defended by Arms. —The Eſtates of a Kingdom may maintain their
Religion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the tyranny and malice of the Prince.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Doctor had the greateſt influence on the <hi>Education</hi>
of that Noble Gentleman, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Chaplain to the Family, and Preacher at
<hi>Covent-garden</hi> for many years. It is alſo very obſervable what this
Gentleman ſays in his <hi>Paper delivered to the Sheriffs,</hi> where he
<hi>bleſſed God that he fell by the Ax, and not by the fiery tryal;</hi> as
if it were ſafer to die as a Traytor than a Martyr. —But he ſays,
<hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever apprehenſions I had of Popery, and</hi> OF MY OWN SEVERE
<hi>and heavy ſhare I was like to have under it when it ſhould
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> in all probability had ſome regard
to the loſs of thoſe <hi>Lands</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from his
<hi>Anceſtors,</hi> but had been in <pb n="188" facs="tcp:101057:103"/>the days of
<hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth alienated from the <hi>Church,</hi> and which by the
return of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,</hi> might be taken from his Family. And he being
perſwaded, as he expreſſeth it in that Speech—<hi>I did believe,
and do ſtill, that Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is breaking in upon the Nation; and that thoſe
who advance it, will ſtop at nothing to carry on their deſigne;</hi> he on
the other ſide would ſtop at nothing to <hi>keep it out.</hi> This moſt
likely made him ſo zealous for the <hi>Bill of Excluſion;</hi> and
unhappily engaged him (the <hi>Bill</hi> being it ſelf <hi>excluded</hi>) in
this <hi>other</hi> deſperate Attempt: for, as <hi>Solomon</hi> obſerved,
<hi>It is a ſnare to a man to devour that which is holy.</hi> And indeed
there is no other means ſo likely to bring in <hi>Popery,</hi> as the
<hi>impotent</hi> and <hi>unlawful outcrys</hi> and <hi>endeavours</hi> of
<hi>Fanatical perſons</hi> pretending to keep it out. <hi>Religion</hi> is
for the moſt part made a <hi>Cloak</hi> and <hi>Pretence</hi> to ſerve
Intereſt.</p>
            <p>In Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s days, when the <hi>Pope</hi>
ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited the Queen for a <hi>reſtoration of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> and
<hi>Dignities,</hi> it was firſt propoſed to the <hi>Cabinet-Council;</hi>
where the Lord of <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> being preſent, and knowing himſelf
greatly concerned, fell into a great paſſion; and breaking his <hi>Chaplet
of Beads</hi> from his girdle, flung them into the fire, ſwearing deeply,
<hi>That he valued his ſweet Abbey of Woo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>harn more than any fatherly
Counſel or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands <pb n="189" facs="tcp:101057:103"/>that could come from Rome.</hi>
Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Queen conſidering of what temper others of the Nobility might
be, was diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged from proſecuting that deſigne.</p>
            <p>This Lord delivered a Paper to the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs, wherein he
acknowledgeth <hi>that when he was at a meeting at Mr.</hi> Shepherd<hi>'s,
there was ſome diſcourſe about the feaſableneſs of ſeizing the
King's Guards: and ſeveral times by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in general diſcourſe
elſewhere</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I have heard it mentioned as a thing eaſie
to be done; particularly at my Lord</hi> Shaftsbury<hi>'s; but never
conſented to it as fit to be done. That the Duke of</hi> Monmouth <hi>told
him he was glad that he was come to Town; for my Lord</hi> Shafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury <hi>and
ſome hot men would undo them all, if great care were not taken. That being at
Mr.</hi> Shepherd<hi>'s with a Company that met there, there were things ſaid
by ſome with more heat than judgment. And it is by ſome inferred</hi>
(ſaith he) <hi>that I was acquainted with theſe heats and ill deſignes,
and did not diſcover them: but this is but miſpriſion of Treaſon.</hi>
He ſays, <hi>Nothing was ſworn againſt him but ſome diſcourſe about
making ſome Stirs; and this is not levying War againſt the King, which is
Treaſon, and not the conſulting and diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing about it, which was
all that was witneſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me: and the deſigne of ſeizing the
Guards, was conſtrued a deſigne of killing the King; and in that I was
caſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="190" facs="tcp:101057:104"/>
            <p>Captain <hi>Walcot</hi> in his laſt Speech ſaid, <hi>I do
neither blame the Judges nor Jury, nor the Kings Council: I onely blame ſome
men that in reality and truth were deeper concerned than I, that came as
Witneſſes againſt me.</hi> He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth that he was <hi>invited by
Col.</hi> Romſey <hi>to ſome meetings where ſome things were
diſcourſed of in order to aſſerting their Liberties and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties,
which they looked on to be invaded and violated: That Mr.</hi> Weſt <hi>often
diſcourſed with him concerning lopping off the two Sparks, meaning the King
and the Duke; and propoſed it might be done at a Play, ſaying, that then
they would die in their Calling: That he bought Arms to that end, and ſaid
they had fifty em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to that end: That he told them the kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the King
would carry ſuch a blemiſh and ſtain with it, as would deſcend to
Poſterity; and that he having eight Children, he was loath they ſhould be
blemiſhed with it: That by the Law of the Land he ought to die, for being in
thoſe meetings where a War was debated.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing asked by Dr.
<hi>Cartwright</hi> whether the death of the King was propoſed while he was
there; he anſwered, <hi>It was ſo, and that he and thoſe Lords who were
like to ſuffer, were under general apprehenſions of Popery and Slavery
co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in.</hi> And he confeſſed to the Doctor, <hi>He was guilty enough
to have his life taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;</hi> adding, <hi>The ſame meaſure we mete to
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, <pb n="191" facs="tcp:101057:104"/>that meaſure God will mete to us.</hi> So
that on this mans Confeſſion, if there were no other, (conſidering the
circumſtances wherein he was, being a perſon formerly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the
Rebellion, a man of Eſtate and Parts) nothing can be more evident than both
parts of the Plot <hi>(viz.) to raiſe a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, and to murther the King
and his Royal Brother.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which was farther confeſſed by Mr. <hi>Hone,</hi> who told Dr.
<hi>Cartwright</hi> that he was <hi>guilty of the Crime according to the Law of
the Land, and to the Law of God;</hi> that <hi>he</hi> was <hi>to meet the King
and Duke of</hi> York, <hi>but did not know at that time when or where, nor
what was his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs;</hi> and afterward, that he told Mr. <hi>Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
he was for killing the King, and ſaving the Duke of</hi> York; for which
being asked a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he anſwered, <hi>As to that, I think this, That the
Duke of</hi> York <hi>did openly profeſs himſelf to be a Roman Catholick,
and I did ſay I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſpoſe of the King than the Duke of</hi>
York. And being asked again by the Doctor, <hi>Had you rather a Papiſt
ſhould reign over us, as you take him to be, than the King?</hi> he replied,
<hi>I do not know what to ſay to that.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Captain <hi>Walcot</hi> it ſeems had ſaid of <hi>Rous,</hi>
that <hi>he would die an Atheiſt:</hi> and in truth, ſuch bloudy men are no
better; they are of the mind that Colonel <hi>Morly</hi> and ſome other 
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:101057:105"/>Commanders in <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Army were, who ſaid,
<hi>They would caſt themſelves on any Prince, even on the Turk, rather than
ſuffer themſelves to be ſubdued by the King.</hi> But this Mr.
<hi>Rous</hi> did confeſs, <hi>That ſince the Hurly-burlies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Parliaments going off and coming on, he had been a hearer, and underſtood too
much of ſome kind of Meetings, and eſpecially of thoſe that call
themſelves Proteſtants, who are ten thouſand times worſe than any
others; and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God to forgive him that he had not been as careful and
diligent, and as ready and forward to diſcover them a great while ſince. I
gave his Majeſty</hi> (ſays he) <hi>an account to the beſt of my
knowledge, and he ſeemed to be well pleaſed, and thankt me for it: but
before I had power to put it in writing, the Council thought it fit that I
ſhould be committed to Priſon. That there was a deſigne to ſet up the
Duke of</hi> Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, <hi>I will not ſay, while the King reigns; though
ſome extravagant hot-headed men have taken upon them to diſcourſe theſe
things, but not any worthy man. I know thoſe that have been worthy to be
called by that name, have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in my hearing, that in oppoſition to the
Duke of</hi> York, <hi>if the King be ſeized, they would ſtand by the Duke
of</hi> Monmouth. <hi>There are others that were for a Commonwealth, and ſome
few for the Duke of</hi> Bucks. He confeſſeth, that <hi>Goodenough told him
the King was to be <pb n="193" facs="tcp:101057:105"/>taken off as he came from</hi>
Windſor; <hi>that they wanted a place of meeting in order to it; and the
place pitched on was</hi> Black-heath, <hi>where</hi> Rous <hi>adviſed that a
Ball of Silver worth thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or forty pound might be thrown up, and the people
invited to come and drink a Bowl of Punch: which would have gathered thirty or
forty thouſand in two or three days time: That this</hi> Goodenough
<hi>ſpake in baſe Language con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Duke of</hi> York, <hi>calling
him Rogue and Dog, and that we will do his work; and that after the Kings
deceaſe, the Duke of</hi> Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth <hi>having a Vogue with the People, must
of neceſſity ſucceed.</hi> And he confeſſed <hi>that it was just in
God, and righteous and just in the King, that he died.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the 6th of <hi>February</hi> 1683. in <hi>Hillary</hi>-Term,
<hi>John Hambden</hi>

thereof, but contriving and malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and ſeditiouſly intending to
bring the Kings Government into hatred, diſgrace, and contempt, did
conſpire and endeavour to make the Kings Subjects to believe that the ſaid
Inquiſition was unduly taken, and that the ſaid Earl was mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by
ſome perſon in whoſe cuſtody he was. And to bring this to effect, they
procured falſe Witneſſes to prove it. And to perſwade others to the

            <div type="part">
               <head>How the Intrigue was managed, in brief.</head>
               <p>The 13th of <hi>February</hi> in the morning, the King and Duke
going to viſit the Tower, in the interim of their being there, that dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
accident of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> cutting his own throat happen'd. The
rumour of the one and the other, cauſed a great concourſe of people. Among
the reſt, there was one <hi>Edwards</hi> his ſon, a School-boy of about
thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years old, that having played Truant in the Tower that morning upon
this occaſion, thought it beſt to tell ſome ſtrange ſtory when he
came home to Dinner, to palliate his Truantry; and accordingly goes home 
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:101057:107"/>and tells his Mother and Siſters that he ſaw a hand
throw a Razor out of the window of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> his Chamber.
They were ſurpriſed at this, and charged the Boy to tell truth, and not to
tell lyes to excuſe his play, as he uſed to do. He perſiſted in it. Mr.
<hi>Braddon</hi> being told of this Boy, goes to his fathers houſe,
pretending he came from Sir <hi>Henry Capel</hi> and the Counteſs, to examine
the Boy: which when he had done, he writes a Paper, and reads it to the Boy,
for him to ſigne. The Boy refuſes to ſigne it, becauſe (he ſaid) the
whole matter was a lye. So <hi>Braddon</hi> went away: but coming another time,
he got the Boy to ſigne it, telling him it was no harm. He alſo found out a
Girl of about the ſame age, that ſaid ſhe ſaw a hand throw out a bloudy
Razor, but from whoſe window ſhe knows not: and ſhe ſaid many others
ſaw it, but ſhe could name none <hi>Braddon</hi> goes with this to Sir
<hi>Henry Capel,</hi> deſiring his aſſiſtance in the proſecution of
the Earl's murder: but Sir <hi>Henry</hi> directs him to a Secretary of State,
it being of publick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern. He goes to a Secretary, has his little
Witneſſes examined before the King in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and the buſineſs found
falſe and frivolous. Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> would not reſt here (being in
Conſcience bound to proſecute the Murder, as he alleadg'd) but reſolves
for the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; <pb n="197" facs="tcp:101057:107"/>and goes to one Mr. <hi>Speke,</hi>
deſiring his Letter commendatory to Sir <hi>Robert Atkins</hi> in
<hi>Glouceſter</hi>-ſhire: which was granted by that Gentleman, who alſo
ſent his man along with him, to defend him from Aſſaults. To colour this,
it was pretended that <hi>Braddon</hi> had word ſent him that my Lords death
was diſcourſed the ſame day it was done, at <hi>Marlborough,</hi> and at
the Poſthouſe in <hi>Frome;</hi> nay at <hi>Andover,</hi> two or three days
before it happened. Mr. <hi>Speke</hi>'s Letter to Sir <hi>Robert Atkins,</hi>
concerning <hi>Braddon</hi> (which he had about him when taken) <hi>commends
his great integrity and courage, thanking the perſon 'twas writ to for great
kindneſs to him and his friends; hoping to get my Lords Murder tryed before
the Tryal of any in the Tower; ſaying the Tyde run ſtrong againſt them:
and he muſt not be called</hi> Braddon, <hi>but</hi> Johnſon, <hi>for fear
of being knockt on the head: he deſires the Knights di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections in the
management. He ſays Mr.</hi> Braddon <hi>has been at great charge and trouble
already; and he knows few that would have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken it but
himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And all this pains was taken, to inſinuate to the people, that
becauſe the King and Duke were that morning walking in the Tower, about the
time this Murder was done, therefore they deſigned it. <hi>How baſe, how
deviliſh, and helliſh a deſigne is this!</hi> (as my 
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:101057:108"/>Lord Chief Juſtice juſtly exclaims.) After a long and
fair Tryal, they were found guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but continued under Bail till next Term,
when, on <hi>April</hi> 21. <hi>Braddon</hi> was Fined

               <p>Among the reſt of the late Conſpirators, was one <hi>James
Holloway</hi> (a forward buſie young man, Inhabitant of <hi>Briſtol</hi>)
who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been acquainted with all the Methods, and attended on all the
motions of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne (without effect, bleſſed be God) till its
diſcovery, then ſenſible of his guilt and danger, thought it time to
conſult his own ſafety; and leaving <hi>London</hi> in a diſguiſe, he
ranged ſeveral parts of <hi>England</hi> as a dealer in Wool, till he could
find an opportunity to take ſhipping: which having obtained, he ſet ſail;
and after ſome loſs of time by ſtreſs of Weather, he made
<hi>Antegua</hi> in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> reſolving to viſit the
reſt of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribby Iſlands</hi> alſo, and ſo to St.
<hi>Chriſtophers:</hi> which he judging to be the ſafeſt place, ſent
thence to his Factor at <hi>Nevis</hi> about ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns he had there;
which Factor diſcovered him; whereupon Sir <hi>William Stapleton</hi> ſent 
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:101057:108"/>to St. <hi>Chriſtophers</hi> to apprehend him; and
thence brought him to <hi>Nevis,</hi> where he was priſoner thirteen days,
and then ſent for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> where being come, he was examined before
the King in Council, and committed to <hi>Newgate,</hi> till
<hi>Eaſter-Term</hi> 1684. he was brought to the <hi>Kings Bench-Bar,</hi> to
<hi>ſhew cauſe why he ſhould not ſuffer death</hi> (he having been
Outlawed for High-Treaſon in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.) He told the Court <hi>he had
nothing to ſay, having told all he knew to his Majeſty, from whom he hoped
mercy.</hi> The Court told him <hi>they had nothing to do with the Kings mercy;
but they had leave to let him take a Tryal, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Outlawry,
whereby he might have opportunity to make his defence, if he had any thing to
ſay for himſelf.</hi> But he declaring that he had nothing more to ſay, a
day was ſet by the Court for his execution (as is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual in Outlawries)
which was done at <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn</hi> on the 30th of <hi>April</hi> 1684. He had
liberty to ſpeak there what he pleaſed, and held a long Dialogue with the
Sheriffs; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering them a Paper (which he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be his own
writing) which is a kind of Epitome of what he had before deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd to Mr.
Secretary <hi>Jenkins.</hi> And ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſhort Prayer, he was hang'd
drawn and quarter'd, and his Quarters brought back to <hi>Newgate,</hi> and
ſent thence to <hi>Briſtol,</hi> which <pb n="200" facs="tcp:101057:109"/>ſhould have
been the Scene of his activity in this curſed Tragedy.</p>
               <p>He ſays in his Paper delivered to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary, that asking
one <hi>Tyly</hi> of <hi>Briſtol, What News</hi> (<hi>July</hi> 1681) he told
him, <hi>All naught; and if ſome ſpeedy courſe be not taken, we ſhall
be all undone: for—they have got Sheriffs to their minds—</hi>
(<hi>naming</hi> North <hi>and</hi> Rich) <hi>who will find Jurors to believe
any evidence againſt a Proteſtant: and ſo hang up all the Kings friends
by degrees.</hi> He told him alſo, that <hi>all the Proteſtant Gentry,
naming the Earl of</hi> Shaftsbury, <hi>Lord</hi> Howard <hi>of</hi> Eſcrick,
<hi>and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, were come to a reſolution, ſeeing fair means would not do,
but all things on the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſide are miſrepreſented to the King
by ſuch great Criminals, and none more in favour than thoſe, to take the
King from his evil Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and that by an Inſurrection
in</hi>—London, Briſtol, Taunton, Exeter, Cheſter, Newcaſtle, York,
<hi>and other places in the North; and that there would be a conſiderable
party in</hi> Scotland, <hi>and another in</hi> Ireland. Mr. <hi>Weſt</hi>
told him there was a deſigne to take off the King and the Duke coming from
<hi>Newmarket</hi>—to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent bloudſhed. <hi>Holloway</hi> diſlikes
that, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>the deſigne was onely to take the King from his evil
Counſel.</hi> He calls it a PROTE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STANT PLOT.</p>
               <p>He ſaith to the Sheriff, <hi>I hope it will be a 
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:101057:109"/>ſatisfaction that there was a Plot.</hi> Again, <hi>I
pray God that no other people may concern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with Publick affairs
out of their own way; and that the Scriblers might be put down; for they do
more to the Kingdom than any thing elſe:</hi> Which was both the beginning
and end of his diſcourſe with the Sheriffs.</p>
               <p>And he begins his Paper left with the Sheriffs, with exclaiming
againſt <hi>Pamphleteers</hi> and <hi>News-Scriblers.</hi> And
afterwards—<hi>And did by ſome Scriblers and News-mongers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
know moſt publick affairs—which they undertook to repreſent according
to their own humour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He declares his <hi>hearty ſorrow for yielding thereto, or
acting therein, being ſatisfied it might have cauſed very much bloudſhed
in the Nation.</hi> He concludes: <hi>I repent not my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; and
could I diſcover more, would do it throughly, though I find not mercy with
man.</hi>

               <p>On Thurſday, <hi>Feb.</hi> 14. 1684. Sir <hi>Samuel

               </p>
               <p>It was upon an Information exhibited by the Attorney-General,
wherein is ſet forth, That there having been lately a horrid Plot
diſcovered, Sir <hi>Samuel Bernardiſton</hi> intending to ſcandalize the

that before ſpake of him very indecently, now court, cringe, and creep to

upon which the Gazetter was called to account for it, who alleadged for
himſelf, that a Perſon of great Quality ſent him in writing the words

the laſt day of the Term, all the Priſoners that were in the Tower upon the

               <p>By that which hath been ſaid, it clearly appears how near a

               <p>And it will eaſily appear, that the <hi>leading Fanaticks</hi>
have miſled their Diſciples with more <hi>invincible prejudice</hi> and
<hi>implicit faith</hi> than any of the <hi>Popiſh Prieſts</hi> do their
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes; who can perſwade them, that <hi>that Church</hi> which hath

Wilwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, Prayers in an unknown Tongue, adding to the number of

in their deteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <pb n="207" facs="tcp:101057:112"/>of <hi>Popiſh Doctrines;</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And in truth, there needs no other Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prove how

<hi>nothing</hi> that was practiſed in the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> long
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Popery was known in the World. And it is very apparent, that we have
not more <hi>diſpleaſed</hi> the <hi>Fanaticks</hi> by retaining thoſe
<hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Ceremonies</hi> and <hi>ancient Orders</hi> of the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Church,</hi> than we have <hi>incenſed</hi> the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> by
retaining of them: for by theſe <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical Orders</hi> and
<hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Decency,</hi> we have ſuch a <hi>beauty</hi> added to
<hi>Holineſs,</hi> as was in uſe in the moſt <hi>pure</hi> and

                  <hi>Rome:</hi> and this hath

<hi>grief,</hi> and envy to ſee a Church much nearer to the <hi>primitive
conſtitution</hi> than their own.</p>
               <p>I doubt not but the Reader will joyn with me in this Opinion,
that it is a <hi>neceſſary duty</hi> incumbent on all ſorts of
<hi>Fanaticks</hi> that have accuſed our <hi>Church</hi> and
<hi>Government</hi> of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for retaining thoſe <hi>innocent</hi> and
<hi>indifferent things</hi> agreeable to the <hi>primitive practice,</hi> to
make a publick declaration of their abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of <hi>Romiſh principles</hi>
and <hi>practices,</hi> ſuch as I have already charged them withal. To which
I may adde their claiming of a <hi>Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy</hi> above <hi>Princes</hi> and
<hi>Parliaments</hi> in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <hi>Eccleſiaſtical,</hi> and divers other
things, which are the moſt <hi>pernicious</hi> and <hi>Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Practices</hi> of that Church; which have drawn the
greateſt <hi>reproach</hi> and <hi>odium</hi> on the <hi>Reformation.</hi>
And if they would heartily perform this duty, I doubt not but they would ſee
a neceſſity of <hi>returning</hi> to the <hi>Communion</hi> of the
<hi>Church</hi> as it is now eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and to <hi>aſſiſt</hi> her
in her <hi>conflicts</hi> againſt the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome:</hi> than
which, there is no means more probable to keep out that <hi>Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
againſt which they pretend ſo great an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion. <pb n="209" facs="tcp:101057:113"/>And to induce them hereunto, I ſhall recommend to their ſerious

pronouncing the King guilty of <hi>Perjury,</hi> and that he had <hi>no

                  <p>The <hi>Scottiſh book</hi> called <hi>Naphtali</hi> ſays,
<hi>Whatever indignity is done to the Solemn League and Covenant, is no leſs

our Saviours caſting out Devils by</hi> Beelzebub, <hi>but far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
They condemn all <hi>Acts of State</hi> againſt it, particularly this which
follows, which ſome would chuſe to <hi>die</hi> rather than conſent to:
<hi>I do ſincerely affirm and declare, that I judge it unlawful to Subjects,
upon pretence of Reformation, or other pretence whatſoever, to enter into
Leagues or Covenants, or to take up Arms againſt the King, or thoſe
commiſſionate by him; and that all thoſe Gatherings, Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Petitions, Proteſtations, and erecting and keeping of Council-Tables that
were uſed in the beginning, and for carrying on of the late Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, were
unlawful and ſeditious: and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, that thoſe Oaths whereof the one
was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called</hi> The National Covenant, <hi>as it was ſworn and
explained in the year</hi> 1638, <hi>and thereafter; and the other
entituled</hi> The So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn League and Covenant, <hi>were and are in
themſelves unlawful Oaths, and were taken by and impoſed upon the Subjects
of this Kingdom againſt the fundamental Laws and Liberties of the ſame: and
that there lieth no obligation <pb n="219" facs="tcp:101057:118"/>upon me or any of the
Subjects from the ſaid Oaths, or either of them, to endeavour any change or
alteration of the Government either in Church or State, as it is now
eſtabliſhed by the Laws of the Church and Kingdom.</hi> But inſtead of
<hi>allowing</hi> this Declaration, they declare their <hi>aſſent</hi> to
all the <hi>Rebellions</hi> and Bloud that had been ſhed in defence of their
<hi>Field-meetings</hi> and <hi>Covenant</hi> againſt the <hi>Kings
Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> as of <hi>Wariſton, Guthrie,</hi> &amp;c. ſhortly after the
Kings Reſtoration; the Rebellion at <hi>Pentland-hills</hi> and
<hi>Bothwel-bridge,</hi> the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of <hi>Melvil Mitchel,</hi> and the
<hi>Ruffians</hi> that aſſaſſinated the <hi>Archbiſhop;</hi> and that
<hi>Field-Faſt</hi> at <hi>Jedburgh</hi> in <hi>Tiveot-dale,</hi> where were
ſeven <hi>Field-preachers,</hi> and five thouſand people, the men being in
<hi>Arms,</hi> to <hi>ſeek God for three things,</hi> (viz.) <hi>To put an
end to their Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, To give them Grace to repent who took the Bond for
Peace,</hi> and <hi>That he would bleſs thoſe Lords that were gone to</hi>
London. This was ſuch another <hi>Fast</hi> as thoſe that were kept in the
days of their Q <hi>Mary:</hi> of which ſhe was wont to ſay, That <hi>ſhe
was as much afraid of a Faſt of the Miniſters, as of an Army of
Souldiers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And yet if you will believe <hi>themſelves,</hi> or ſome
<hi>Advocates</hi> of theirs <hi>nearer home,</hi> there are not a more
<hi>innocent, peaceable,</hi> and <hi>harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs</hi> people in the world; as
the Author of <hi>Naphtali</hi> ſaid of the <hi>Rebellion</hi> of
<hi>Pentland hills: <pb n="220" facs="tcp:101057:119"/>There hath not been in</hi> Britain
<hi>ſuch a company of men in Arms for the Covenant and Cauſe of God, for
ſound Judgment, true Piety, Integrity, and fervent Zeal, and undaunted
Courage.</hi> But all this <hi>Zeal</hi> and <hi>Courage</hi> was ſtill
directed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>eſtabliſhed
Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and <hi>Worſhip</hi> of God. For in the year 1679. the
Convention of Eſtates gave the King a Tax of 30000<abbr>
                        <hi>l.</hi>
                     </abbr> to
maintain a Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Foot, three Companies of Dragoons, and three Troops of
Horſe, to ſuppreſs the <hi>Field-Conventicles;</hi> which met in Arms:
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which their Leaders preached, ſaying, <hi>It was given by the
enemies of Chriſt to drive him out of his Kingdom; and it would be as great a
fin to pay it, as it was in</hi> Judas <hi>to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray Chriſt: and that now
was the time to try them whether they would have Chriſt for their King or
no.</hi> And the ſame Ruffians that mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the <hi>Archbiſhop,</hi> did
ſeveral times lay wait for the <hi>Collectors</hi> of this Tax; and they ſo
perplexed the peoples Conſciences, that a Servant of the Earl of
<hi>Dondonald</hi> fell diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted through trouble of mind for having
aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted his Maſter in laying the Tax on <hi>Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcot.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is that <hi>little Siſter</hi> for whom the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Peer</hi> pleaded, that having <hi>no Breaſts,</hi> ſhe might, like the
<hi>Amazons,</hi> have liberty to <hi>take up Arms,</hi> and once more enter
<hi>our Nation,</hi> 
                     <pb n="221" facs="tcp:101057:119"/>and rent us in pieces as formerly.
And it were eaſie to ſhew, from the Writings of ſome of <hi>our own
Nation,</hi> that the <hi>ſame Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> have been preached to the
people of this Land, who have greedily <hi>ſwallowed</hi> and
<hi>digeſted</hi> the ſame, and think themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>ſame
obligation</hi> of <hi>Covenant</hi> as thoſe <hi>barbarous people.</hi> Dr.
<hi>Lake</hi> in a Sermon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord Mayor, ſays, That
<hi>diſcourſing ſome Rebels that were then in Goal in</hi> Scotland,
<hi>who did openly avow the Rebellion, and refuſed to pray for the King, He
told them they were variouſly reported to be Jeſuits, or Jeſuitically
affected, or to be Fifth-Monarchy-men, wild ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Fanaticks.</hi> They told
him they were <hi>neither one nor other, but true Presbyterians according to
the Covenant.</hi> He replying, <hi>That we had Presbyterians in our own
King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, who yet did not obſtinately maintain ſuch King-depoſing and
murthering Doctrines;</hi> They told him, he <hi>did not underſtand them; for
they believed the ſame Doctrines, but onely wanted Power and Courage to act
them.</hi> And at their execution they deſired the people to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
<hi>That they died true Presbyterians, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Covenant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is another <hi>Artifice</hi> of <hi>theſe People,</hi>
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the practice of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> that they keep their
People in <hi>ignorance,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of an <hi>implicit
Faith</hi> and <hi>blind <pb n="222" facs="tcp:101057:120"/>Obedience,</hi> as the
<hi>Papiſts</hi> do; and bring them up in <hi>ſtrong prejudices</hi>
againſt their <hi>Governors.</hi> Some have been ſo mad, as to <hi>baptize
their Children</hi> into the <hi>National Covenant;</hi> which they are not
aſhamed to compare with <hi>The Covenant of Grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Alexander Gibſon,</hi> Clerk of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
Privy-Council, certified, <hi>May</hi> 13. 1678. that one <hi>David
Ferguſon</hi> taken at a Field-Conventicle, being asked why he kept not to
his Pariſh-Church, anſwered, That he had <hi>ſworn the Covenant, whereby
he was obliged not to hear Biſhops, Deans, or Curats:</hi> and that others
being asked why they kept Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, anſwered, <hi>To hear Gods
truth:</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing demanded what that was; they anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>They could
not tell.</hi> And upon examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they could not ſay the <hi>Creed,</hi>
the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> or <hi>ten Commandments.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Jo. Dickſon</hi> preached to them, That <hi>all the
Biſhops and their Clergie never did nor ever will convert one Soul.</hi> They
believe without farther enquiry (being forbid to read the Books written for
<hi>Obedience</hi> and <hi>Conformity</hi>) <hi>that Epiſcopacy is
Antichriſtian, and Presbytery is Chriſts own inſtitution.</hi> They hold
with the <hi>Papiſts, That the actions of their Kirk and Teachers in
Field-Conventicles, and armed and fighting men, is not Rebellion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Presbytery is not ſubject to the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <pb n="223" facs="tcp:101057:120"/>Power:
That the Subjects may enter into Solemn Leagues and Covenants, without and
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Prince: That Kings may be excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate and depoſed; which
ſome of them have practiſed againſt his preſent Majeſty: That not the
King in ſome caſes, but the Kirk have pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to convocate and diſſolve
Aſſemblies; and that they may make Laws without the King: That Salvation is
not to be had but in their Communion.</hi> They injoyn new <hi>Articles of
belief;</hi> as, <hi>That Epiſcopacy is an Antichriſtian Order; and ſo
are the Church-Feſtivals and Ceremonies: That the Oath of Supremacy is an
unlawful Oath, and the People are abſolved from it: That the Power of the
King is origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in the People, and that there is a mutual obligation
between them; and if the King per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form not his part, the People are free from
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming theirs: That for the good of the Kirk and Gods Cauſe, they may
rebel againſt their Prince: That the Prince nor any Secular Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er can
ſilence or deprive a Miniſter, who is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to none but Chriſt: That
Paſſive Obedience to the unjuſt commands of a Prince, is as great a ſin
as Active Obedience to the ſame: That a private perſon may kill a
Magiſtrate by impulſe of the Spirit, after the Example of</hi> Phinees,
<hi>to deliver the Kirk from Oppreſſion: That it is lawful to kill
Proteſtant Biſhops and their Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, as enemies to true Godlineſs, and
ſuch as <pb n="224" facs="tcp:101057:121"/>would bring the Kirk to a ſlaviſh
dependance on the King. James Mitchel,</hi> who was execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for attempting
the murther of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop, ſaid in his dying Speech, <hi>They are all
bleſſed that ſhall take the proud Prelates and daſh their brains
againſt the ſtones;</hi> as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſome Ruffians did by the
Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are their <hi>Principles,</hi> and all theſe they
have <hi>practiſed,</hi> when they had oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities. They come little
behind the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> for <hi>equivocation</hi> and perſiſting in
<hi>falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,</hi> where they think their <hi>lives</hi> or the good of the
<hi>Kirk</hi> concerned.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jo. King</hi> being charged for bearing Arms againſt the
King in the late Rebellion, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied it, until one that apprehended him ſwore
that he had both Sword and Piſtols. To which he anſwered, he <hi>did it not
in an hoſtile manner:</hi> which was a <hi>Jeſuitical
Equivoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He <hi>bore teſtimony againſt that woful Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy ſo

                  <p>If <hi>this deſigne</hi> had ſucceeded, no <hi>two
Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> in the world had been more <hi>like,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are

two last helliſh Plots,</hi> or whether they were not <hi>Twins;</hi> or as
it is in the Riddle, <hi>Mater me Genuit, eadem mox gignitur ex me,</hi> may
puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zle the Reader to reſolve. It is certain the ſame <hi>plaſtick
Principles</hi> formed them both, and the <hi>Subjects</hi> were equally
diſpoſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thoſe <hi>Forms</hi> which have ſo affrighted the
Nations: and there is little difference (the name excepted) between a
<hi>Clement</hi> and a <hi>Melvil,</hi> a <hi>Ravilliack</hi> and a
<hi>Mitchel,</hi> a <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> and a <hi>Cargil,</hi> or the
<hi>Jeſuitical</hi> and a <hi>Fanatical</hi> Regicide: both make the
<hi>King</hi> accountable to the <hi>People;</hi> both are for
<hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicating, depoſing,</hi> and <hi>aſſaſſinating</hi> of
Kings; both have been ſuch <hi>Fire-brands</hi> as have kindled
<hi>conſuming fires</hi> where-ever they have fixed their <hi>cloven
feet.</hi> It is no great wonder that they are ſometimes <hi>transformed 
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:101057:123"/>into Angels of light,</hi> ſeeing Satan himſelf may
be ſo transformed: neither of them can do <hi>their work,</hi> if they
ſhould appear in their <hi>proper colours,</hi> armed with <hi>Piſtols</hi>
and <hi>Blunderbuſſes,</hi> in flames of <hi>fire,</hi> and an horrible
ſtench of <hi>Gunpowder</hi> and <hi>Brimſtone:</hi> they come <hi>clothed
with Zeal as with a Cloak,</hi> and in <hi>Sheeps clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> with demure
looks <hi>and fair ſpeeches to deceive the hearts of the Simple;</hi> but
<hi>inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they are ravening Wolves,</hi> and <hi>by their fruits you may
know them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is not a pretence of acting for a <hi>Good Old
Cauſe,</hi> or <hi>the Catholick Church,</hi> that can juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie unnatural
<hi>Rebellions</hi> and <hi>Bloudſhed:</hi> they who do ſuch things, are
<hi>of their Father the Devil,</hi> though they own <hi>Rome</hi> or
<hi>Geneva</hi> for their <hi>Mother.</hi> It is ſaid of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi>
that meeting with a young man in the Country exactly like him in growth and
features, he asked him merrily <hi>whether his Mother was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver at Rome.
No,</hi> ſaith the young man, <hi>but my Father hath been there;</hi>
meaning, it was more likely that <hi>Auguſtus</hi> and <hi>he</hi> had
<hi>one Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> than that he ſhould be the <hi>Son</hi> of
<hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus.</hi> Though our <hi>Fanatick Plots</hi> were
<hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived</hi> by thoſe that were never at <hi>Rome,</hi> yet the
<hi>Principles</hi> that <hi>begot</hi> them, moſt certainly came from
thence. The <hi>Fanatick Zeal</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing <hi>Popiſh Principles,</hi>
hath brought forth many of thoſe <hi>Plots</hi> and <hi>Conſpiracies</hi>
which <pb n="230" facs="tcp:101057:124"/>have ſo often diſturbed our <hi>Peace</hi> and
<hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> And by this time I hope the <hi>vizard</hi> and
<hi>pretence</hi> of theſe men will vaniſh, <hi>(viz.)</hi> that ſuch of
them as have ſuffered by the hand of Juſtice, have died as
<hi>Patriots</hi> of their Country, for their <hi>zeal againſt Popery,</hi>
and in defence of the <hi>Liberties of the People</hi> againſt
<hi>Tyranny</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary Government.</hi> This hath been pleaded a
thouſand times in behalf of a <hi>Noble Peer;</hi> and perſons of the
<hi>ſame Principles,</hi> but of the <hi>loweſt rank,</hi> have plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it
for <hi>themſelves. This deſigne</hi> (ſays <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>) <hi>is
not onely againſt me, but againſt all the Proteſtants in</hi> England
<hi>that have had the courage to oppoſe the Popiſh Plot;</hi> and dies
praying <hi>that his may be the laſt Proteſtants bloud that murdering
Church of</hi> Rome <hi>may ſhed in Chriſtendom.</hi> And in his dying
Speech he ſays, <hi>He went armed to</hi> Oxford <hi>to defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in
caſe the Papiſts ſhould make any attempt by way of Maſſacre or
Invaſion;</hi> and <hi>that he came thither to live and die with the
Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if the Papiſts and their Party (as was ſworn and feared they
would) had offered to deſtroy the Parliament.</hi> And generally all that
died as <hi>Conſpirators,</hi> endeavoured to perſwade the People that they
fell as <hi>a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to Popery,</hi> and died <hi>Martyrs for the Old
Cauſe;</hi> which hath been no other than the <hi>oppoſing</hi> of
<hi>Monarchy</hi> and the <hi>eſtabliſhed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> 
                     <pb n="231" facs="tcp:101057:124"/>under the odious names of <hi>Popery</hi> and
<hi>Tyranny;</hi> when they have had no more ſenſe of <hi>true
Religion</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> than the Rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bons intended to be worn in
their Hats, that could onely declare <hi>No Popery, no Tyranny;</hi> but was
intended to diſtinguiſh a Party for cutting of Throats.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have ſhewn the Intrigues between the
<hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Fanaticks</hi> to deſtroy the <hi>eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
Church</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> of the Engliſh Nation; than which, there
is none in the world ſetled upon better foundations, for <hi>Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Liberty,</hi> and <hi>Moderation;</hi> nor hath any had <hi>more ſignal
tokens</hi> of <hi>God</hi>'s Almighty <hi>Providence,</hi> and wonderful
<hi>Bleſſings.</hi> We may truly ſay in the words of <hi>David</hi>
concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his enemies, <hi>Many a time have they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted us from our
youth up, but they have not prevailed againſt us.</hi> We have been like a
City <hi>beſieged</hi> by <hi>two potent enemies;</hi> and while <hi>one</hi>
Party hath <hi>attacked</hi> us on one ſide. the <hi>other</hi> hath taken
advantage to <hi>ſtorm</hi> us on the other: and though they never could
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree among themſelves, yet they alway con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire both in
<hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Practices</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the
<hi>eſtabliſhed Government</hi> both of <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State.</hi>
And it is not to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered if it be ſo for the future, ſeeing thus it
hath been not onely with us from the time <pb n="232" facs="tcp:101057:125"/>of the
<hi>Reformation;</hi> but ever ſince the <hi>Goſpel</hi> was
<hi>preached,</hi> it hath had <hi>many enemies</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate againſt it.
<hi>For of a truth</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Peter,</hi> Acts 4.27.) <hi>againſt
thy holy Child Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, whom thou haſt anointed, both Herod and Pontius

                                    <hi>Laſtly,</hi> That all the <hi>Outcrys</hi>
made by the <hi>Fanaticks</hi> ſince the diſcovery of the <hi>Popiſh
Plot,</hi> have been directed chiefly to the ruine of the <hi>Eſtabliſhed
Government</hi> both in Church and State, as if <hi>they</hi> favoured <hi>that
Perſwaſion,</hi> and as if <hi>none but themſelves</hi> were enemies to
<hi>Popery:</hi> whoſe <hi>ſeparation</hi> from the Church
e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed, in the judgment of the <hi>wiſeſt,</hi> even of their
<hi>own Party,</hi> is moſt like to bring it in; and nothing more like to
keep it out than <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience</hi> to the <hi>King,</hi> and
<hi>Conforming</hi> to the <hi>Church</hi> as it is now eſtabliſhed.</p>

                  <p>Thus <hi>Baxter</hi> in his Preface to the <hi>Defence of the
Cure,</hi> p. 17. <hi>Our Diviſion gratifieth the Papiſts, and greatly
hazardeth the Proteſtant Religion; and that more than moſt of you ſeem to
believe or regard,</hi> ſpeaking to the <hi>Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts. And by that
ſeparation, Popery</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>will get ſo great advantage as may
hazard us all; and we may loſe that which the ſeveral Parties do contend
about. Defence of the Cure,</hi> Introduction, p. 52. <hi>Two way eſpecially
Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry will grow out of our Diviſions:</hi> Firſt, <hi>By the odium and
ſcorn of our Diſagreements, Inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtency, <pb n="237" facs="tcp:101057:127"/>and
multiplied Sects, they will perſwade people that we muſt come for <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity
to them, or elſe run mad, and crumble into dust, and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals:
thouſands have been drawn to Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or confirmed in it by this Argument
already. And I am perſwaded that all the Arguments elſe in</hi> Bellarmine
<hi>and all other Books, have not done ſo much to make Papiſts in</hi>
England, <hi>as the multitude of Sects among our ſelves. Yea, ſome
Profeſſors of Religious ſtrictneſs, of great eſteem for Godlineſs,
have turned Papiſts themſelves, when they were giddy, and wearied with
turnings, and when they had run from Sect to Sect, and found no conſiſtency
in any.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>Either the Papiſts by increaſing the
Diviſions would make them be accounted ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, rebellious, and
dangerous to the publick peace; or elſe when ſo many Parties are
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to beg and wait for Liberty, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts may not be ſhut
out alone, but have Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the rest. And ſhall they</hi> (ſaith
Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>) <hi>uſe our hands to do their work, and pull their
freedom out of the fire? We have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready unſpeakably ſerved them, both in
this, and in abating the Odium of the Gunpowder-plot. ana their other
Treaſons, Inſurrections, and Spaniſh Invaſion.</hi> And in
<hi>Sacrilegious Deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> p. 103, 104. <hi>We are indangered by
Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions principally, becauſe the ſelf-conceited part of Religious
people would not be ruled by their <pb n="238" facs="tcp:101057:128"/>Paſtors, but would
rule them—you have made more Papiſts than ever you or we are like to
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover. Nothing is conſiderable that any Papist hath to ſay, till he
cometh to your Caſe</hi> (and ſaith) <hi>Doth not Experience tell you, that
with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Papal unity and force this people will never be ruled or united? It is
you that tempt them to uſe Fire and Faggot, that will not be ruled: and must
you that ſhould be our Comfort, become our Shame, and break our hearts, and
make men Papiſts by your temptations?</hi> Wo to the world becauſe of
offences, <hi>and</hi> woe to <hi>ſome</hi> by whom they come.</p>
                  <p>But a much wiſer and better man than Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
hath demonſtrated the ſame thing Preface to his <hi>Sermons,</hi> Sect. 18.
<hi>Three ways</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>our diſſenting Brethren, though not
intentionally and purpoſely, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and eventually have been the great
Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Roman interest among us.</hi> 1. <hi>By putting to their
helping hand to the pulling down of Epiſcopacy: and it is very well known to
many, what rejoycing that Vote brought to the Romiſh Party, how even in</hi>
Rome <hi>they ſung their</hi> Io Paeans <hi>on the tidings thereof, and
ſaid triumphantly, Now the day is ours, now is the fatal Blow given to the
Proteſtant Religion in</hi> England. 2. <hi>By oppoſing the interest
of</hi> Rome <hi>with more violence than reaſon.</hi> 3. <hi>By frequent
miſtaking the Queſtion, but eſpeciallly <pb n="239" facs="tcp:101057:128" rendition="simple:additions"/>through the neceſſity of ſome falſe principle or other, which
having once imbibed, they think themſelves bound to maintain, whatever
becomes of the common Cauſe of our Reformation; which may ſuffer as much
through ſome mens folly and indiſcretion, who pretend to be the most
zealous Proteſtants, as by all the arts and deſignes of our open enemies:
for many a man, when he thought moſt to make it ſure, hath quite marred a
good buſineſs by over-doing it.</hi>
